I agree with many previous commenters: if Mr. Weiner is truly a changed man he ought should show it by supporting his wife for Mayor. It's not a crazy idea.
I voted for him before, BUT I WILL NOT VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN.  Imagine how people in these times feel reading about his $100,000 campaign bid from this creep!  Please!  Anthony, this wasn't an affair, which is your personal business and, while it would be hurtful to those you love, is really no one else's business.  This is about a really pretty creepy act followed by lie after lie in a pathetic attempt to deny it.  My daughter was in college when this all happened and all I could think was, "Gross!  He's almost MY age."  Give it up.  You won't get elected.
I would vote for Anthony Weiner, not because he can be a story of redemption, and not because he deserves a second chance.  Quite simply, I believe in his politics and his policies and I believe that he is the best person to be Mayor and to run my City. I believed that four years ago and I beleive it today.<br/><br/>His antics are forgiveable, and, I dare say more common than most of us imagine.  The fact that he did them while he was in office puts him in some pretty strong and popular political company.    
It amazes me that someone could be married to a woman as stunning as Huma Abedin and still feel compelled to behave badly online. Such is the toxic combination of ego and narcissism that dominates so many political men. <br/><br/>Water under the bridge though and I am sure Mr. Weiner has suffered enough. Besides, posing on Twitter is a far cry from "Hiking the Appalachian Trail".  Anthony--please run for office again and WIN, but for goodness sakes, put a lid on that other stuff.
Weiner, along with disgraced South Carolinian Mark Sanford, appear to be creating a new kind of politician: the redemptive candidate.  This is particularly appealing to evangelical Christians, no slouches when it comes to voting for con men ("let the guy redeem himself - every sinner  deserves a second chance").
Remember what happened when President Clinton made similar mistakes?  Mr. Clinton's unbounded need to be liked and instinct for denial diverted his presidency from progress to damage control, tarnished Mr. Gore's 2000 campaign, and helped elect of George W. Bush with tragic consequences. (It is hard given Mr. Clinton's new popularity to remember how toxic he was after the grueling affair and impeachment proceedings.) <br/><br/>Holding elected office requires of men the utmost responsibility, integrity, and self-control. Men who act on thoughtless primitive impulses are too risky to run and elect. Such men give opponents the power to defeat us and reverse our progress. I care too much to put the fate of our cities, our states, and our nation into such hands.
I was looking for a "teachable moment" where we'd all learn about a manic phase and how well the person can do when treated. Or some other psychiatric disorder where we'd see other articles with brain scans that light up when the brain is disordered.  We would all learn to welcome a "recovering" mentally ill person back into society; because it was the mental illness that caused the problem, not the man himself.<br/><br/>I'm half-way thru the article; it's apparent that there is no "teachable moment". I'm not going to finish the article and waste my time reading about a person with such incredible character flaws.       Just go live a nice life as a recluse.You've "exposed yourself" enough already.
I'm a southerner and down here there's nothing like an uplifting sin and redemption narrative to help with a political comeback. Sometimes even serious backsliding on the road to redemption can be forgiven. As a personal matter, I'd definitely vote for the miscreant former congressman. That said, it's all up to New Yorkers. I'll be watching with interest for cultural differences and similarities. 
I'm not sure if Mr. Weiner would be the most viable candidate to become the mayor unless his prerequisite was to attend anger management therapy on a weekly basis.  The way he treated his staff during his tenure as a congressman was appalling and there would be a staff of revolving door employees who would not put up with his juvenile temper tantrums and public insults.  He was worse than an Army drill instructor.
I was never a big believer in Redemption.  Unless, of course, Redemption means doing a better job of covering your tracks.
That this man could even consider public office says more about New York than about him. I wouldn't consider him for a street sweeper although latrine orderly might be appropriate. 
What an enormous pair of egos.  Each should leave New York, get a real job, and try to contribute something positive to the world -- finally.  It's not too late, even for such people as these. (That poor child.)
Thank you for writing this article.  You clearly had amazing access, and Weiner and Abedin are strikingly open.  This is reminding me of how important it is to put your relationship first, in life.  Even though they claim to be putting their marriage back together and moving forward, you can see there has never been a passionate love between them.  Their marriage just looks like a business partnership.  If Weiner runs, who knows, I might vote for him. He bravely fought for the 9/11 first responders and his voting record was superb. But overall, this is a reminder that if your relationship is off-balance, everything else in your life falls off balance as well.
Whatever anyone may think of Weiner's antics or possible sex addiction, one thing is for certain.  He is one LUCKY guy to still have Huma by his side!!
My wonderful  late wife was an acquaintance of Huma A. When I informed her that Huma and Weiner were dating, her reaction was a dropped jaw and "What is she doing with that guy?" I replied, :"I guess she wants to be married to the first Jewish President." I stand corrected. BTW - This pre-dated the scandal by quite a while. 
Looks like they took a stab at establishing a narrative here:  "Poor Anthony, his troubled brother was killed and his parents did not provide the emotional tools to deal with it."<br/><br/>Then there is the other line of, "Vote for me because Huma is a saint and she deserves to be the wife of the Mayor of NYC."<br/><br/>Mr. Weiner, if you have REALLY changed, you'd go out and find another career for yourself.  You would no longer have the need to feed your narcissism.  An honest career, even if it is a lowly one. 
If this article was a trial balloon sent up by Weiner, by now he should be reading the comments.  And if he wasn't embarrassed Tweeting, NYT readers should do the trick.
If Mark Sanford and David Vitter can be forgiven for "hiking the Appalachian Trail" and sleeping with prostitutes while running on "family values", there's no reason why Anthony Weiner can't while NOT pretending to be holier than thou.
Anthony Weiner for President of the  United States in 2016,
Lets see.weiner sends an offensive text and he's damaged goods. Quinn subverts the will of the people and serves as bloom bergs lap dog and she's a legitimate candidate, according to her enablers in the media. Now she is complaining about ads questioning her ethics and temperament. Why doesn't she just pass a bill or better yet exit stage right
I imagine Weiner reading all these comments and feeding his voracious ego. Creepy.
 The article got a little long for me and maybe I missed it but SO WHAT!   I don?t get why he quit. The news media got to pluck a ripe one off the vine for a while but so what. That?s the life.<br/>     Yes, sending the underwear Twitter (or whatever) is creepy but everyone?s sex life is creepy. His wife is the only judge that counts here.<br/>    Everyday in marriage there are bad things that can define it. Meanness,violence, alcohol abuse, horrible father, rotten husband with a temper. The list is long and sordid for reasons to leave a marriage but an underweargram is only creepy.<br/>   The guy was a great spokesperson and had guts and knowledge to say how he felt about issues.<br/>  By the way, nobody has to own up to their sex life to other people. Including politicians. It only fuels the media and while we are at it, Elliot Spritzer is the smartest guy I ever heard on television. I?d vote for him any time.
WEINER FOR MAYOR!<br/><br/>This is a family matter, none of my business, and has NOTHING to do with what kind mayor Mr. Weiner would make. 
Let's see if I have this right?  A lawmaker poses in his underware which was funny because Beckham looks better in his TV ads. Conservative Chistians want him removed as that's not our Religious Values.  But we accept a Governor reporting he has been having an affair for 9 years while showing family values and doesn't even tell his wife/kids who hear his confuss his love for his soulmate Maria.  We watch Gov. Schwarzenegger Father a child with his long time immigrant housekeeper while his wife hugs the housekeeper. Newt Gingrich cheated on two wives and has a third but promise not to do that again and even want violate ethics or steal.  Consevatives like to bring up the Clinton affair while ignoring the 15 year affair of  VP that George HW Bush  with Jennifer Fitzgerald only to end when he was elected President.  Don't  worry Barbara Bush knew all about it just like Jenny Sanford knew about Maria, but Conservative wives keep their mouths shut and smile.
Weiner is the digital age version of a flasher.  That's quite a serious mental health problem.  I certainly would not vote for him without being convinced that the problem has been dealt with, and that would take a lot more than a vague assertion that he's "been in psychotherapy." <br/><br/>Even without this problem, I don't see anything in this article (or any article I've read about him) suggesting that he has experience running a large organization like the New York City government or that he would be any good at it.  Bloomberg built and ran a huge business.  What has Weiner ever done besides run his mouth on television?   
Has he grown up or has he just gotten bigger?
Anthony Weiner - Why not? He has national experience - sorely needed in NYC, is strong against terrorism, pro first responder and took a strong interest in the federal investigation of the WTC collapse &amp; building code reform in NYC. While I do not condone what he did, others have committed far more serious trangressions &amp; have been given more than a second chance!
--They had never spent more then 10 days together consecutively and thought that was a good enough platform to get married and have a child --  I just don't see how any reasonable thinking person would want either of these people making decisions with the general publics interest in mind--   <br/><br/>hindsight is 20/20 I know but looking back I think it's a bit of a shame because her intuitive GUT feeling was to stay away from him from the get go--<br/><br/>listen to your gut<br/><br/>He should be forgiven on a human level because we all have short comings but as a servant of the public the buoyancy of your character is what carries your connection to the people and we all know how much character he has--   
It's funny how "getting a job" or "paying the bills" doesn't seem to be a factor in any of his decisions.  Is she supporting them with family money?  Is his family?  In such a long story, one where we are supposed to identify with, understand, or empathize with the subject, this key aspect of his relationship and survival would be nice to know.  Is just sitting around the house and eating at nice restaurants without ever worrying about a paycheck an option for him -- because it's not for most people who suddenly lose their job and ability to get hired in their chosen field.
Wow. They haven't been to a "major event" in two years. My heart goes out to them.
It might be nice to hear Weiner say what kind of mayor he'd hope to be and how he'd differ from the rest. There's a lot on the table in this race, and none of the Democratic candidates has nailed my vote yet.
Forgive me, but this is just too much information.  I feel dirty after reading this - like someone with half a brain would after skimming the NY Post or People Magazine.  I don't need to invade someone's world and thought process in such intimate detail to know that monogamy and sexuality are complicated, that a powerful person would stumble over telling the truth, fearing getting skewered over such silliness.  Besides, eating escargot and a cheeseburger is much creepier than sending a crotch shot or carrying on like a horndog via social networking.  Ugh.  Good for Ms. Abedin.  "It was the right choice for me. I didn't make it lightly.? Love and commitment conquers all.  Who knew. <br/><br/>No wonder we get so little done on public policy - locally and nationally.  I would have been more interested in hearing about the work Ms. Abedin accomplished as Deputy Chief of Staff, and likewise Mr. Weiner's work in Congress.  That would have been more worthwhile than delving in to such personal failings and far more relevant to Mr. Weiner's pursuit of the mayoralty.  
Is Weiner kidding ? He's misguided in thinking New Yorkers need a tainted leader.
Some politicians should just stay away permanently once they publicly reveal a personality disorder. Weiner is merely one more example of a slew of politicians who have humiliated our Houses of Congress. 
People in South Carolina gave would-be-comebacker Mark Sanford a victory in a primary recently -- and he actually had a sexual affair.  Weiner didn't go nearly that far.  Why should there be so much doubt about Weiner being elected to office again when Sanford's act of infidelity was much, much worse?
He has a huge ego and awful judgment.  That sounds like a terrible choice for an elected official.  As a married adult this guy was sending pics of his privates to multiple people...that is odd.
How terrible life has been for Anthony and Abedin. To quote this Times article ...<br/><br/>"They haven?t been to a major event together ? no White House Correspondents Dinner, no red-carpet events ? in nearly two years. ?We didn?t want to make other people uncomfortable,? Abedin said, ?but also, we just didn?t want to deal with it. I have now gotten used to people asking, over and over again, ?How is Anthony?? Oh, he?s good! ?But how is he doing?? He?s doing fine.?<br/><br/>These are two martyrs. We owe it to Anthony Weiner to elect him Mayor !
They are not MY power couple. 
All this article proves is that the Power Elite are alive and "well" in the U.S., and most of  all right here in New York City. Or is it a tie with Washington, DC ?
I have one quibble with this article. People don't stare at Huma on the subway because she is married to Weiner. They stare at her because she is stunningly beautiful. 
Please give me a break Weiner, stay home, find something else to do. Your a typical example of a greedy politician who just cannot stand being out of power, we do not miss you at all.<br/>Weiner lied no less than eight times regarding his embrassing locker room pictures taken by him, and tweeted. I cannot even believe he would try a come back after this sick photo episode of himslef.<br/>Please, I beg you  try getting a real job, You are a discrace, we need leaders that will set examples for our children and your not one to do that for certain.
New Yorker's love a comeback story.  He has my vote. 
Given the mealy-mouthed, two-timing, obstructionist or brown-nosing postures of most of our politicians on both sides of the aisle, for me Anthony Weiner, in his legislative capacity, always seemed terribly bright and articulate.<br/><br/>He seemed genuinely passionate about issues that matter.  And he was unafraid to get up and speak his mind.  Occasionally he shouted too loudly into C-Span cameras.<br/><br/>He also, like most of us, had /has faults.  Driven, not particularly insightful of his own inner life, not aware enough of his subordinates, not caring enough of a family that loved him.<br/><br/>Sound familiar?  Why it could be a description of that hugely popular (among some) Bill Clinton.  Or a whole raft of Republican politicians.<br/><br/>Are his missteps so profound that they obliterate all else?<br/><br/>Not for me. <br/><br/>There are precious few really smart , articulate politicans around...the Reids and Boehners and Schumers of the world are hacks.<br/>I can think of only one truly wonderful politician now...and that is Bernie Sanders. <br/><br/>I can fully envision a City that would be led by Weiner...who is progressive, smart as a whip (yes, despite the missteps) and should be in public service.<br/><br/>I think Spitzer should come back to public life, too.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think we need their brains.
Man is a beast and needs keepers.  NYC needs leadership not a career politican with no judgement .  Please Mr. Weiner get a job and a life and stop expecting to live off the public . 
My bet is an independent spoiler campaign set up for a shot at Mayor Lhota in 2017. He would surely get significant segments of ethnic liberal voters inimical to a Quinn in City Hall.
I feel as if I just finished reading an upcoming episode of The Good Wife minus the acerbic humor the King's use to make watching this kind of subject matter palatable. <br/><br/>And.......the other problem is all the mea culpa's in the world will never make Anthony Weiner as appealing as Chris Noth!
Seriously, I think if there's anything the nationwide Democratic wins of the 2012 elections showed us, is that the public has much less patience for egregiously bad leadership.  New Yorkers are too wise to vote in somebody like Weiner who has already demonstrated a profound level of foolishness, not to mention entitlement.  From this piece, he sounds like one of those people who lives in an alternate universe where he somehow "deserves" a top-notch political career.  <br/><br/>Sorry buddy, in this universe, stupid actions have consequences.  Nobody did this to you.  You crashed your own car.  <br/><br/>And c'mon.  I'm no prude, but a mayor -- when we've all seen his privates?   Yechh.  <br/><br/>He missed out on a promising career as performance artist.   
Breibart is a very reputable news source; it's one of the only muckrakers in this day and age.<br/><br/>Watching the documentary Hating Breitbart for the real story behind the Shirley Sherrod incident.  The complete opposite of what you've been told.
If New Yorkers elect this lying, egotistic, moral defective as mayor of their great city, they will get exactly what they deserve...which is to be the laughing stock of the country, and the world.
I'm not disenchangted with Anthony Weiner because he tweeted photos, but rather his vitriolic lies after he was caught, as they say, "with his pants down."  The difference between Mr. Weiner, who I would not vote for, and Mr. Spitzer, for whom I would vote, is the honesty with which they dealt with their respective crises.
This is what disgusts me with politics.  A guy like Weiner, or Rangel the tax evader, get busted, *maybe* lose their jobs temporarily and then jump right back in.  And we forgive them and then complain about politicians being unethical.  The lesson here is don't forgive.  You violate the public trust, you're gone, have a nice life in the private sector.  Stop re-electing these guys.
Why do these wonderful, talented women have to stand aside as their sophomoric husbands strive for the limelight?  Let her run for mayor!
Go for it, Anthony. Run for mayor. 
Welcome back Anthony. Put the fear of God back in the GOP and Democrats on the take.<br/>Governor Spitzer, we are still waiting for you to get back in the game.
I hope he runs! Even with his flaws, he is a FAR BETTER candidate than any of the so-called realistic candidates in the race today.<br/><br/>The Twitter scandal aside (which was ridiculous and funny and not especially relevant to his abilities as a politician), he would win the mayoral race. That's a pretty good sign that he should run and that he deserves people's time and attention. Whether or not he would win, who knows. But once he gets on the campaign trail, I think a lot of people will disregard or simply not care about the scandal and will focus on his magnetic personality.
Huma Abedin's claim to fame appears to be from her reprising the role of the butler Stevens in The Remains of the Day; albeit a designer clothed and well coiffured version. <br/><br/>Park Avenue apartment, de la Renta, Malandrino, Nolan, Prada, and Marc Jacobs handbags, and never the same outfit twice. Guvmint service must pay really well these days. Cherchez l'argent.
Just read to the bottom of the first page of the article, and that was enough. Would love for him to be Mayor!  
Remember he tried to destroy someone else, a reporter, reporting on a BIG story. Coward tried to blame someone else. Also, there were teenagers involved.
I'd vote for her; not him.
Without his connection to the Clintons, Weiner would not even rate a mention in the East Mayberry Gazette. Tiger Woods, Petraeus, Vitter, Gingrich, Mark Sanford, Bill Clinton and now Weiner. Comeback kids? Other than Woods because it's Masters Week and Clinton because he was President, no. They're all media fodder. There is absolutely nothing about Anthony Weiner that deserves the extensive coverage he has been given. This must be embarrassing for some employees of the Times. It should be. There's real news out there to cover.
On a mayoral run, Wiener would be red meat to the ceaseless moralistic bombast that would issue from Joe "Brooklyn Musuem" Lhota.  I am afraid a Weiner candidacy, whatever his strenghts, would become a distracting hairsplitting debate, and a tiresome referendum on an unseemly issue of very little importance. New York doesn't  need this. Our image would tarnish here and abroad.  He should run for a different office. <br/><br/>As for the article, I share the cynicism of some commenters about a multipage puff piece.   Political advertisment disguised as Journalism.    I also find it interesting that the recipients of his twits are suddenly are referred to  as "other women",  as though Weiner's lapse were of a more benign affliction of misplaced attention.
Why do creepy people like him keep creeping in? What is going to be different now? I never understand why people like this get rewarded with more power. Oh well....
I liked his politics but I liked John Edwards' politics too.  You don't know w/ an utter narcissist how much of their politics are THEIR politics vs what they need to keep their narcissism fed at that moment.
Weiner is a classic political personality,which is to say a deficient person. It's all about him and his very sad, sick unfulfilled and unfulfillable ego. He would be pitiable if he were not a risk to the body politic on the remote chance he could yet get elected. And she must be a case of the same sort to enable this sad character. <br/><br/>None of this because of what he did but because he still does not understand that it exposed an out of control ego maniac with little to contribute to the world, to government, to politics, to anything except satisfying his need to be the center of attention. Must be murder in that household with him competing for attention with the baby. <br/><br/>Go away Anthony, get a real job, earn a real living, donate your $4 million to charity or send it back to the favor seekers who gave it to you. And leave the rest of us alone. This New York city voter will never vote for you, under any circumstances. Give it up. Get a job. Get a life. Live like everyone else does.
In 2006 I complimented my manager's necklace. I was "let go" a week later and have not held a full time job since. Where is MY second chance guys? If America loves a redemption story, I'd like a chapter or two. 
Weiner's sexuality, so long as it is not criminal,is between him and his wyfe. None of anyone's business any more than if he were Gay and polyamorous. The notion its our business is based on the idea that sex is dirty. Guess what? Biology is dirty. The sexual organs are located in the lower body: get over it. Bacteria smells. Sex has odors. Sexuality is complex. You think strait laced folk are not compulsive? Let's not even begin to think about what goes on in the gonads or brains of Republican conservatives married in the suburbs. I think i just saw one in a limo in the south Bronx under a bridge. Cast the first stone, o ye innocents. Yeah, Weiner is compulsive, you can tell just by looking: where do you think his drive comes from? Vayner fur Mayur!
This is a very well written article that shows Weiner is has not accepted the blame for his actions. It was my upbringing, there were no hugs so I made up for it by sending photos of my crotch to strangers. I feel for Huma, but she is no better. I am guessingl, but I bet Hillary told her to stuggle through this somehow and someday she can become a senator, failed presidential candidate and Secretary of State.<br/>My other question is where is all their money coming from? They live in a very expensive part of town, neither seems to be working yet there regular hangout is the Grammercy Park Hotel? I can't even afford to walk by that place, much less go inside.
just a follow up to my earlier comment--<br/><br/>the people here who are screaming that Weiner lied, are the same ones who are so unforgiving of the tiniest infraction or smallest slip in their personal life, that drive a man to lie about unimportant nonsense in the first place. <br/><br/>If we cared less about what is none of our business, then people could be more honest about their mistakes
Sanford in South Carolina now Weiner in NYC. We're running out of talented people free of serious character disorders. Now if we to bring back Eliot Spitzer... I would welcome that. He and Elizabeth Warren could go after the Wall St banksters who continue to be wealthy and free of incarceration.
anybody who goes into politics is clearly out of his mind, weird and pervy to do so. I bet more than half our esteemed lawmakers have social media fetishes or bizarre private behaviors akin to the one that recently gave Weiner the opportunity to (briefly, if he gets his career back) experience his fatherhood. If politicians were stable and well-balanced people, they'd be teaching high school instead of chasing power. Who cares about the guy's personal life? We just need someone who is willing to be a competent sucker for power and America, and so far Weiner seemed to have been.
 ?You know what, he can act like a jerk,? Almond Zigmund, his sister-in-law, says. ?But that?s one of the things that I respect him for.?<br/><br/>This man is surrounded by sycophants and enablers,.  <br/><br/>He?s damaged goods and needs to let go of the narcissistic notion that he has the character and mettle for political leadership.
Anthony Weiner served in Congress as a strong progressive who stood for all the values that, in a politician, made me admire him.<br/>All the while, similar to Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, he was playing a tacky, immature series of sexual flirtations on the side to feed a needy ego.<br/>When this behavior became public, he invented excuses; when the excuses didn't hold water, he simply refused to admit the truth for days.<br/>What his entire episode did was to plumb to ethical rot that had reached down deep into his soul, the rot which fed the need to play the game, then lie about the truth.<br/>All was exposed.<br/>Now he has been in therapy for a couple of years and he feels he is ready to resume the political life where he was forced to leave it.<br/>Now the big question New Yorkers must answer:<br/>The New York civic scene is a cesspool of corruption, all the way from contracts for apartments (snaring the unsuspecting public), to contracts for construction and services all the way up to the monumental task of trust that is required to administer the management of the city with integrity.<br/>And integrity is the name of the game.<br/>How firm and ruthless (it takes a soupcon of ruthlessness to stand up to corruption) will Weiner be if a scandal is exposed during his administration?<br/>That is the decision regarding trust that New Yorkers must make to participate in this election.<br/>Personally, were he running for mayor of our city, I would ask those same questions.
So, he married Huma when he was, what, 45-46 years old, which meant he was single for quite a while, free to indulge an irreponsible, immature life that was not that far removed from his college days. Old habits are hard to kick until reality slaps you in the face.
Never once did Mr. Weiner say what he will do for New Yorkers as mayor.  Not once.  This explains why many people may be willing to "forgive" his past, but not vote him back into office.<br/><br/>Is it really all still just about Anthony?  I'd say so.
I hope he does not run.<br/>He does not deserve to be in elected office.
Seems like he's grown up a lot and may even be better than he was. 
Our institutions are anti-democratic, and we're in big trouble regardless of whom we elect.
 Always agreed with Weiner politically. Hope he has found true humility.
Huma seems like the real gem here. I am much more interested in learning what her professional future entails than her husband. 
It took me a while to figure out what bothered me about this story. <br/><br/>1) Why didn't the reporter ask Mr. Weiner what else he has lied about? Because isn't that what is at the root of the problem: can this man ever be trusted again? My gut says no, but i wish the reporter had asked this.<br/><br/>2) I seriously wonder what the lovely Huma would have done if she had not been pregnant. I worry for this child because you can take it to the bank that the day will come when he asks the same question. I have seen it happen. Never pretty. Poor Jordan.
What I find troubling about this is the fact that Weiner  does not seem to have really gotten to the root cause of his extremely shady behavior.  Nowhere in this article does he truly admit that what he was doing was disgusting, perverted, and frankly a bit predatory. This man should not run for mayor and I would never vote for him.  
None of us are perfect!  I sure wouldn't let my past mistakes stop me!  (Let us know who casts a stone and we'll fill you in --- nobody's perfect and we can usually find the person who knows why!)
This article is a sad testament to our hyper-narcissistic time, where the most intimate details of someone's private life are put on display for all the world to see.  In so doing, we destroy a healthy sense of privacy and become little more than what T.S. Eliot memorably called "a face to meet the faces that you meet."  And we meet those faces on Facebook, Twitter, and all the other places where we can pretend to be authentic.  And we apparently meet them in The New York Times as well.  
I wish no ill will on Mr. Weiner and his family.  Many blessing to them, now and always.  May NYC and its residents continue to be blessed by Mr. Weiner NOT reentering the political arena.
Read the entire 8300+ words and found it odd that not once did Anthony Weiner couch his desire to run for office as a vehicle with which to serve the citizens of New York.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was implied?  <br/><br/>Still, it would have been nice if he had said he was eager to get back to work for the voters instead of curious whether or not people would love him enough to vote for him again.
With due respect to Mr. Weiner, there are -- or ought to be -- plenty of other equally or better-qualified candidates deserving of our vote and less plagued by peccadillos, ego, hubris and utter immaturity. 
Do we really need another narcissistic politician?
The really troubling part of this (these comments, media coverage of this event, politics in general) is that we're evaluating people for public service based on their personal lives rather than policy positions and voting records.<br/><br/><a href="http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/23162/anthony-weiner#.UWWx_aJlkQg" title="http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/23162/anthony-weiner#.UWWx_aJlkQg" target="_blank">http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/23162/anthony-weiner#.UWWx_aJlkQg</a>
The American voter and consumer has shown time and time again that we are incredibly forgiving of our male politicians and celebrities who have been found guilty of sexual transgressions as long as those men are willing to admit guilt, demonstrate humility, and disappear for a period of time.  <br/><br/>This article does a good job of humanizing a man who's name and actions illicit an immediate "ewww" reaction from the average person.  I've never been a fan of Weiner because of his obvious egotism but I always liked his unrelenting progressive liberal stance and his chutzpah.
What a jerk.  I guess part of the "playbook" is to have the NYT do a long, fawning article about their playbook.
No.   Why not?   Carefully read background during scandal.   I believe that he is unqualified; lacking local government experience, and over abundant ambition<br/>gland, and with all due respect?he'll make the place a cash cow of opportunity.<br/>He has already proven that he's untrustworthy.  That's another reason.  In other<br/>words  he's proven to be capable of treachery.   He already is wearing a sign<br/>that states.   " AW?Untrustworthy and Proven So."   
People's lives fall apart for innocuous mistakes and bad luck.  They have to rebuild their lives from the bottom up.<br/>Mr. Weiner's comment that he didn't know when he'd crossed the Rubicon is so telling.  This man's behavior seemed pretty outrageous from my very mid-western perspective.  Spending a few months hanging out with his beloved progeny- was that his "time out"?<br/>Sex addict, big deal.  I think maybe it is...<br/>But I think this media blitz is all about Ms. Abedin, so he can find a new job and she can move forward.
My 'take' on Weiner has always been, since the scandal, is a not very attractive guy from NYC FINALLY found a 'babe magnet' - celebrity &amp; power.<br/>Then used it unwisely and at a really bad time in his life.<br/>I believe he deserves another chance.
Forget the photos. What about the WRITTEN messages he sent to the young woman? (Go listen to Bill Maher and Jane Lynch read them on YouTube.)  Forget the "men will be men" angle, this is all about intelligence and maturity. ANY human in a position of authority who would be STUPID enough to write those comments on any social media is beyond any bailout from therapy.  I'm happy for him that his wife forgave him, but as for serving the public?  Time to find another place to feed your massive ego, Anthony.
The telling moment in this article was when he says 'I received a phone call from Chris Cuomo saying that they had someone who would say that I texted her...' and then he decides to come clean. <br/><br/>Translation: when he finally realized he wasn't going to get away with it, he decided to tell the truth. 
They are such a creepy couple. He's 12 years her senior and she is staying with this pervert for some reason. Their child doesn't have a chance on a normal life. He has the biggest ego of anyone ever. To think people would elect him mayor of New York City is delusional. He actually wasn't that good a politician the first time. 
Look if a guy sends a picture of his erection to a woman he's trying to impress he's looking for sex, pure and simple. It's a pretty bold (but stupid) move, which indicates he's either had sex with this woman or thought he was pretty close. And she's 21, which obviously appealed to his ego but as my 17 year old Daughter said  - he's a real creeper.<br/><br/>He's still mealy mouthed and evasive about the whole thing which indicates there's more to the story, but to be honest I don't care. But it does indicate a personality trait that should be considered if he runs for office.
Whether of not this guy deserves a "second chance" with his wife if for his wife to decide privately.  What stuns me is how this guy has managed to wheedle such enormous coverage from the biggest news source in the free world.  He must have one heck of a press agent. 
The tweet by itself (or, more likely, among some others like it) maybe not a basis for out right rejection, But taken together with his reported abuse of subordinates, irascibility and generally obnoxious behavior, a fatal combination even if his political views were contained in another tablet initially accompanying those handed to Moses but which got lost until Former Rep Weiner discovered them.
"'There was this sense of ?Yeah, he made a mistake. Let?s give him a second chance. But there are conditions on that, and there are a couple of things we?re going to want to know: What have you been doing since this incident occurred? Did you learn anything from this mistake? How did you deal with it?? They want to know that they?ve put it behind them.'"<br/><br/>This is their strategy, not something voters said in surveys. This guy is fatally flawed. It's easy to say I'm sorry, but remember he pointed fingers and lied until he was backed into a corner and forced to admit it. Not very admirable. Outsized ego, and that is something that never changes. With all the decent citizens out there, why would we settle for somebody who proved he is unworthy? That's the question. Public office is a high privilege. We can do better.
Oh GOD no! He was an awful City Councilman and an awful Congressman. He is a big mouth nothing. Please stay away, get a real private sector job and be quiet! Ugh.
We humans have the  ability to turn a catastrophe of the moment into a lifelong asset. Mr. Weiner can really help others by using what he has learned for that purpose. If I were he I would do so quietly. Run a non- profit. Work in a soup kitchen. Lobby for the homeless. And I wouldn't discount the notion that there is an addiction involved in this story.
Weiner voted in favor of the invasion of Iraq - alone among the entire New York City Congressional delegation.  Reprehensible.  He has not demonstrated the political and personal maturity to merit anyone's confidence - no matter how big a charm offensive he now launches.
My opposition to him as a leader had nothing to do with his lack of fidelity, but with his lack of leadership.<br/><br/>His first response in a crisis was to lie and blame someone else.  I expect more from a public figure.
i have to pick up, also, on weiner's words: "one fateful tweet". he is saying, in essence, that this was the problem- he meant to send the tweet to one, ended up by accident sending it to many. but that is not the problem. at all.<br/><br/> the fact that he was not actually having sex with the other women he was in contact with, to me, may have been a matter of time; who knows? what if he had NOT been caught? what then?<br/><br/>the fact that he was having "very" personal conversations, plus sending those nasty pics to these women, shows the personal sneakiness of a "cheater", and worse, much worse, a betrayal of his extremely lovely and gracious wife, who he is very, very lucky to still have.<br/><br/>there must be, there HAVE to be, some truely redeeming features to this guy, to still have the love of this amazing woman, who he hurt, so deeply, with his vulgar, thoughtless actions. <br/><br/> to me, what he did does NOT mean he can't be in politics again. so many politicians are very different in their personal life, but as long as the politician is a real public servant who cares for what is right for the public, who cares about the people he serves, then, it's ok to get back into political life. what the heck, another creepy politician, ok....as long as he is willing to help the people of our country.
I sure did like his speech in favor of the 9/11 workers.  We could use more of that.  But Mayor of New York..dunno.  Weiner would probably be good as the host of an MSNBC show (but Spitzer would be better).  Perhaps he should be Mr. Mom and write children's books.
The bottom line to me is if she forgives him, why can't we?  He made a mistake.  Who hasn't?  May the one without sin cast the first stone.  There are many sleazy politicians now serving in office who have committed much worst acts (many committed actual crimes) and they seem to have received a pass on their behavior.  Let's just move on.  Anthony Weiner is human and basically a good guy who messed up.  He's much too important a voice in our country to ostracize him from government office.
Of course he will run. And he should. We all make mistakes. And America loves a redemption story.
I remember those pictures too well to look at him now, still, after 2 years.
Just what we need another screwball, egotistical, corrupt, politician as if we don't have enough already.<br/>If the folks in NY want him let stay in NY we don't want his NY politics infecting the rest of the country.
I cannot look at him, but I wish Huma Abedin the best.
I see no problem with Mr. Weiner going back into public life.  I would support him, considering the bunch of do-nothing, bought-and-owned clowns now occupying Congressional seats, or state, county and city political positions.
Sign me up! Moving back to NYC next month and would be first in line to work for Weiner's election!<br/><br/>As a member of the LGBT community, I would be proud to support Weiner to lead our city.  Run, Anthony, Run!
Do we really need a person with questionable judgement as mayor?  Don't we have enough problems between political parties without adding an easy target for ridicule?  What other questionable events in Mr Wiener's career might surface in the future?<br/>How could someone so bright be so stupid?
The only one who should be running is Huma -- away from this man. Weiner would probably make a great mayor, but he is a jerk. Her first impression was right.
Why in the world are we expected to put up with people like this in public life. WHY can't they go away and live their lives, why do they think the rest of us deserve to be afflicted with their problems and their narcissism.
I'm sure he was a very capable person who fought for his constituents,  however on a higher level he typifies what is wrong with our politicians in general.   Instead of working hard and staying clean when in office doing the work for the Citizens, he's too busy flirting with others and flaunting his body on the Internet.   The worse part of it all is that he initially lied about the entire affair saying that someone hacked into his account etc....   <br/><br/>Who in their right mind could vote for a person who lied about his behavior?   You'd have to either be blind or nuts.<br/><br/>New York Person With Integrity and Brains.
I worked in NYC and NYS government and politics for many years.  I also happened to work for a politician who "blew himself up" in spectacular style a few years ago.<br/><br/>I was standing a bit too close to him when he swallowed that particular grenade though I had nothing to do with any of it.  But I knew in one, sickening moment that my career in government and politics was over and that I'd have to find something else to do with my life.  <br/><br/>Making that sort of change in mid-career is difficult (and I was only collateral damage).  It took me a long time just to flush twenty years of accumulated politics out of my blood stream.  Once the fever broke I could think about how to move on.<br/><br/>I applaud Mr. Weiner and his wife for openly and honestly acknowledging the extraordinary turn that their lives took two years ago because of Mr. Weiner's stupidity.  I didn't judge him then and I don't judge him now.  I hope he finds peace and happiness.<br/><br/>I simply want to tell Mr. Weiner that I couldn't imagine a life beyond government and politics, though, of course, I wasn't a Congressman and wasn't on MSNBC all the time.  I read the newspaper now and watch TV as an informed "consumer" of political news and I sometimes wish I were still in the game.  But I'm glad I'm out of it.  <br/><br/>Mr. Weiner, get out of it.  Find something else to do that will give you personal and professional satisfaction.  Your fever hasn't completely broken yet and it's dangerous to make decisions when your fever is still up.
Does this article show that perhaps Weiner has obtained some maturity above the level of immaturity he showed for having done the acts that caused the scandal and the subsequent attempt at cover-up? Maybe. It is probably a process that will take more than a couple of years. I think focusing on his marriage at that time (and quitting his job as congressman) showed more thoughtfulness and maturity than most politicians involved in much worse scandals have shown. <br/><br/>However the real question is does that type of immaturity impede his ability to be an effective politician: to govern and/or represent the people? I am quite ambivalent about the idea that moral decisions in the bedroom/private life should factor in to determining whether a politician should be elected or not. Yes, they are role models for some, and as such should be held to a higher standard, and yet, is that standard perfection? Can sub-par morality be reformed? Does sub-par morality automatically mean poor politician? <br/><br/>I don't think the scandal should prevent him from running. If a voter believes Weiner's sub-par morality is a strike against him then so be it, however I think the answer is that we must not be one-issue voters and look at the entire political agenda of each candidate. 
Give the guy a break. It is not like he was embroiled in corruption or having affairs. What if tomorrow technology provides a tool to read our minds? Are we going to judge people by that? He has not committed a crime and if his wife is okay with him, I think all the people who judge him should get of their camel backs and look around at general standards we the people follow 
To me, it seems like he just wants what all politicians want once they get a taste of it, more power.
Run Anthony, run.
Abedin's early impression, "he's such a jerk",  was right on the mark.  The Weiner man should just go away....forever.<br/><br/>But New Yorkers deserve what they get, and if they are silly enough to fall for this narcissistic POS's crocodile tears of regret I wouldn't be surprised.  Obviously the big media fix is in for this whack job to return to public life without any serious questioning of his fitness for office.  
If you heard Bill Maher read Mr. Weiner's exchanges aloud on his show with Jane Lynch (<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/06/watch.html)" title="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/06/watch.html)" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/06/watch.html)</a> you would know that 1) Mr. Weiner needs to remove himself from the spotlight, permanently, and 2) the New York Times should spend their resources profiling people trying to make a difference or break into politics who think with their brains. 
Surely this is a joke?  I don't know much about the other top-runners for mayor, but I'd surely vote for someone else in order to get this gross, arrogant man away from a position of power.  NY deserves someone with at least a speck of integrity.  <br/><br/>I'd like to see where Abedin goes in the future.  Who knows why she stayed with him?  
Just look at the record. There is something seriously wrong with New York voters. <br/><br/>Start with Heavsi, Spitzer, and the recent arrests. If you have common sense and you observe people over time,  you can get a feeling when someone is not "right" like Anthony. This also does not say much about his wife's judgement. When people are dating and courting, don't they see something? Or do they lie to themselves?<br/><br/>We are really getting the lousy Government we deserve. <br/><br/>Sometimes a man needs to know he is washed up and there is no second chance. He wants to apply for CEO of an 8 million people city. He needs to prove himself for a several years. The down side of electing a Spitzer type nut job is to severe. 
When the scandal broke I was amazed, not so much at the pix he sent as the fact that he so stupidly tweeted them.  I have a few male friends that have done much worse over the internet.  I felt bad for his wife, more than anyone.  I still think he is an extremely smart legislator, I agree with most of his policies and I would vote for him if he ran for mayor.
I date the NY Times to run an article of similar length for all of the other candidates for Mayor.  Why does Anthony Weiner deserve this much attention?
Maybe Wiener knows what marriage is now that same sex marriage exposes its common denominator: faithfulness to each other.
Hmm, sometimes opening up to the public is not a good idea.  <br/><br/>Before this article, I considered Weiner's nonsense to be relatively unimportant as a voter. But this in-depth profile backfired for me; now I see him as a liar and a person whose ambition has totally clouded their judgment ... and I'm only half way through the story but had to comment!<br/><br/>For example, his claim that he only lied to others about the incident because he didn't want to tell Huma the truth.  That is simply not credible.  He was really totally okay with admitting juvenile, lewd antics to the public?  It was just about saving his marriage. C'mon. He is still lying.<br/><br/>Or how about this?  He didn't have any "easy" excuses, like "child abuse".  Oh darn, that would have been so easy! If only! His ambition is so distorted and unchecked that he invokes something so horrible because it would have been more politically convenient for his story?<br/><br/>He should slink back to private life.  Not because of what he did, but because of his essential character that has been revealed. Tough words, but this is what his pollsters want to know, presumably.<br/><br/>PS Who can't love Huma?  And moreover, her point is totally well taken.  The public has no right to judge what the "woman wronged" should do.  It denigrates women and marriage for total strangers to speculate on private relationships.
Weiner should run ONLY if he has distinctive and important ideas to bring to the mayoralty.  The most disconcerting aspect of this piece -- which was, in fairness, about his personal development -- was that in talking about the city's next, very important election, he didn't seem driven by a passionate desire to advance any big ideas for New York, to deal with the post-Sandy rebuild, to address the continuing challenges of the city's schools, or any other critical issues as New York enters its post-Bloomberg era -- personal imperatives that might even transcend his desire for "a second chance."  The next mayor should be in awe of the Bloomberg legacy taken as a whole, regardless of particular policy differences, and should be thinking about how to sustain the city's sense of confidence about its future as a source of leadership and inspiration for an improving world. 
If an admittedly smart guy can be as dumb as he was, why give him another opportunity to mess up again.....who knows, next time he might foul up not just himself, his wife, his family but NYC as well.  And why is the Times not-so-subtly pushing him?  
I think I'd rather see Huma in public office. Anthony appears 'mellowed' now because he's been chastened in a very public fashion. I fear that the very first taste of success would cause the more pugnacious side of his personality to reappear.
The photo on the cover says it all:  "HUMA &amp; Anthony," with Huma not only first in the couple, but prominately front &amp; center, &amp; Anthony off to the side, literally cut off.  <br/><br/>As with many political &amp; marital disasters, the woman is being used as physical protector of the man. It reminds me of a terrorist using children to protect himself.  If you attack Anthony, you are forced to also attack Huma. Her existence legitimizes his.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is Huma's decision (she is an adult) but I resent the cultural pressures that urge women to literally offer themselves up as sacrifices for their Man &amp; to trreat political wives as packaged together with the man. Women do this because it is a short cut to power, &amp; because in many ways we are still viewed as subservient to the man.  But the flip side to the short cut to power is that we are then tied to the man--If Huma were to divorce him, it would certainly damage HER career; the only question is how much (it could be fatal).  <br/><br/>Flip the genders here.  If a woman were to have sent a photo of her genitals, I doubt very much if she'd be ever be considered fit for anything at all; she certainly wouldn't be excused with an 'excess of estrogen'. And even IF she were to try to come back, I cannot imagine a cover photo with her HUSBAND front and center, a title with HIS name first, and her cut off, all with the idea that he is protecting her from harm. No, it is the 'weaker sex' that is called to do that in our culture.
The man is a total ego tripper and full of himself. Perhaps a job at a day care center is fulfilling.
If the NYT cannot stop giving attention to fake scandals that aren't (Anthony Weiner; Larry Craig) and fake candidates (Ted Kennedy, Jr) and fake war justifications (yellow cake, aluminum tubes) and fake, manufactured outrage generally (A LONG LIST HERE), how can we expect a higher standard of journalism elsewhere?<br/><br/>Anthony Weiner may have a personal issue which needs some attention from a psychologist. Maybe he's a narcissist. Or a cheater. Or an exhibitionist. Or he's just human. None of these are political problems. They're personal and marital problems between he, his wife, and his psychologist.<br/><br/>I long for the day when the adults in journalism can deal with these issues like adults. In perhaps France and Italy, they seem to understand that private matters are private matters. At least with Jim McGreevey, General Petraeus, Bill Clinton we can suggest that their decision-making suggests an ethical lapse reflecting upon their office, or their power and influence over those from whom they should have a professional distance.<br/><br/>That's not true with Anthony Weiner. His "scandal" does not make good copy. It makes for boring melodrama.
I've seen far more outrageous behavior on the streets of New York, but I still love the place.
Wow. What a fraudulently done piece, on a truly fraudulent "couple." May God help New York City!
His personal conduct is between Anthonyt and Huma. His political actions never hurt me. If I were still in NY, I'd vote for him.
As a voting citizen of New York City, I am pleading for Weiner to run.  None of the candidates are appealing to me or to anyone I know.  If he ran at least we'd have one good option.  <br/><br/>Though I do not condone his conduct on a personal level, it's not particularly relevant to how he works as a politician.  Most of the greatest politicians in this country (and maybe even the world) had abhorrent personal lives.  Let's focus on how he could help the City, the rest is Abedin's problem.
He's a fierce advocate and should find a venue to channel that and be useful to a deserving cause. (How about a role in cleaning up the VA back log of disability cases and orchestrating an overhaul there?).  You know they'll be back in DC and Huma really deserves her chance to shine in a Clinton White House - a run for mayor now with all the renewed focus on his poor behavior seems nuts to me.  Stay in therapy, keep working on yourself and your marriage and be sure you create a loving home life for your son - this would be admirable.  Teach a class.  Consult. Lend your expertise to something other than your political come back.  Just my two cents.
The people who scare me are not the Weiner types who have flaws.  The ones who scare me are the "perfect" people.<br/><br/>I've often pondered why it is in America we discard people who are 90% excellent when we learn they are 10% rotten.<br/><br/>Truly our culture is unwell.
Bill Clinton, Mark Sanford, Anthony Weiner and so many more: they're twits, children, lightweights, egomaniacs ? I've had enough of all of them. Our politics is debased, politicians like these contribute to it, and we see the results in Washington every day. Pathetic.
I admire Huma Abedin so much, and I think their commitment to their marriage and their child is commendable. But. His explanation that his misbehavior happened solely because of social media is facile. I don't think his therapist or Huma should let him get away with such a simplistic excuse. He needs to dig deeper if he really wants to understand this and change. <br/><br/>The reason I won't vote for him is not because he had a personal crisis, but because he is confrontational and lacks emotional intelligence. 
I am not sure whether to admire Ms. Abedin for trying to keep her family together or to question her judgement by not cutting her loses early and kicking out the bum.
It wasn't "one fateful tweet" - it was a longstanding pattern of behavior that escaped detection until that tweet. He's just sorry he got caught.
I think he should run. I am not at all impressed by the candidates now and I actually liked and still like Congressman Weiner. I also have a huge amount of respect for Huma Abedin and really wish her the best. Ultimately, whatever they do, I hope they can continue to create a loving home for their son. Best wishes to the family.
Weiner made immature adolescent mistakes. It's not surprising, since many in DC who have spent years in the bubble forget how to live and act in a normal adult setting. Putting his personal social flaws aside, Weiner was one of the few true Liberal legislators in congress who advocated for the poor, working poor, and middle class.<br/>I believe that Weiner would make a good mayor, but Spitzer would make a great mayor. Either of the two would be better than the mediocre crop of contenders.
You must be joking.
If Mark Sanford, who actually ran off with a mistress while governor, can run for the first congressional district of South Carolina, I see no reason why Weiner can't return to office in New York.
From Doomberg to Weinergate. Politicians a shameless bunch!
This article could have been written for the Philadelphia Inquirer or some other cheap "celebrity people" magazine you find at the supermarket checkout counter. Here we have two totally political people from two incompatible religious backgrounds, and the article has not a word about their politics or their religions. Weiner is supposedly very pro-Israel, whereas Abedin comes from a totally Muslim Brotherhood family and was raised in Saudi Arabia where her mother teaches. The Muslim Brotherhood is Israel's declared and dedicated enemy. What's really going on here?
Well, I would vote for him again. Wanted to years ago but he changed his mind &amp; stuck with the Congress. Like most people I know what it's like to keep a secret or to lie to a loved one and to fear that secret coming out...it's damning &amp; adolescent but it happens. Weiner was important to our district, important to the Democratic Party, &amp; good for our country. This non-scandal so overwrought by the press is done. If his wife forgives him, so should we all.   
I will not vote for Anthony Weiner for anything, regardless of his positions.  When someone acts outrageously, particularly when acting as representative of a company or organization, he/she is fired - case closed.  Why should politicians be treated any differently?    Weiner does not deserve to be re-hired as a politican.  Let him take a regular job in which he is a mere employee like everyone else (provided he can find one).   May I suggest that he apply to work in his brother's restaurant?
After reading this magazine article on line, I found myself agreeing with almost all the comments. For me, and judging the almost 100% sympathy for the struggles and inner strength of the couples, they should find reading these digital responses comforting. Looking at them from the perspective of a popular poll, or vote of confidence, based on reader agreement with the statements, I would say that Weiner as an adult, holding office and being a public (read publicist's) figure the debate is not yet over. Too many people agree that he has matured as a father and husband but they are still uncertain about his ability to sustain the stress of public office. This does not surprise me. His scandal does not stem from acting inappropriately as public servant but from his private reactions to the stress of having to be judged and not being able to express his personal needs while in an artificially structured celebrity role. I think his weakness can be compared to young and famous actors who act out in immature ways while they continue to perform professionally until they reach a point of no return. Celebrity love is as addictive as drugs. Curing that addiction takes great strength and determination but also time.
I would love to see him come back to public life. He impressed me so much with his passionate yet reasonable arguments in congress. He struck me as a leader with true integrity and I rooted for him. He is now contrite and he and his wife have managed to keep their family together. Of course he acted like an idiot with that text but that is a microscopic error in judgment compared to what some of these other legislators have done. I would definitely like to see him back in the fray. He's learned his lesson. 
With all due respect to both men, I think it's important to remember what the consequences were of President Clinton's similar mistakes.  Mr. Clinton's unbounded need to be liked and instinct for denial diverted his presidency from progress to damage control, tarnished Mr. Gore's campaign, and resulted in the election of George W. Bush with tragic consequences. (It is hard given Mr. Clinton's new popularity to remember how toxic he was in 2000 after the grueling affair and impeachment proceeding.) The nation was otherwise in good shape in 2000, so if it hadn't been for Clinton's mistake I think Gore most certainly would have won the Presidency.<br/><br/>In my view, men must realize that holding elected office requires of them the utmost responsibility, integrity, and self-control. Men vulnerable to thoughtless primitive impulses make mistakes that deliver to our opponents the power to defeat us.  The fate of our cities, our states, and our nation is in their hands. 
As mentioned before, Weiner only got caught on the one ill-fated tweet. Now it appears that after doing a form of solitary penance, he is now going to tip toe back into the political realm. All well and good I suppose however he is forever stamped as having the infamous name-slash-scandal to follow him around the rest of his public, and not so public, career.  <br/><br/>Hillary stuck by her man, but Weiner is no Bill. Keep it from the neck up from now on sir. 
As a Democrat from Illinois--a state with a long history of ethically-challenged governors, feckless congressmen, siphoning state legislators and horribly corrupt local politicians, I can only look at this and wonder:<br/><br/>THIS is the best New Yorkers can do?<br/><br/>Create a glossy multi-page spread about a guy who went around yelling and finger pointing at anyone who ticked him off, got caught in sleazy sexting sessions behind his then-pregnant wife, and now begs New Yorkers to forgive, forget and let him back in so he can do more yelling and finger pointing and...<br/><br/>No.  Sorry.  In the real world, ethics matter.  Chutzpah, schmutzpah.  Your city is full of far more qualified yellers and finger pointers.  You deserve better, New Yorkers.
I wonder about the timing of this article.<br/><br/>In an article last week, the New York Times trashed Councilwoman Quinn as a mean boss and a screamer.<br/><br/>And now a multi-page, full color spread of Mr. Weiner, his child and his very photogenic, Hillary-pal of a wife in the New York Times Magazine   -- the centerpiece of the newspaper's widely read Sunday edition.<br/><br/>A Congressman sending a text of his private parts; a Congressman sending a text of his private parts to a woman not his wife.  These can be forgiven?<br/><br/>But, heaven forbid someone should be considered mean-spirited in America  -- notwithstanding the fact that that person may be effective.
Is there no longer such a thing as 'shame?' Mr. Weiner can best contribute to America by just going away...Forever please..... 
In progressive New York, a Congressman has to resign because he showed off his body on the internet  in a testosterone driven mistake while being faithful to his absentee wife whose traveling around the world as part of the Secretary of State's staff. <br/><br/>In conservative Louisiana a right-wing U.S. Senator Vitter regularly visits prostitutes for sex and he remains in his office and gets re-elected. <br/><br/>What's wrong with this picture?
Don't these politicians have any shame? <br/><br/>For 2 weeks after he got busted, he told reporters his twitter account was hacked and he was a victim. He had the most sincere look while he was lying through his teeth. How can you trust someone like this to run for political office?<br/><br/>Anthony, go back to the rock you were hiding under.
Hmm.  Sounds eerily familiar. Politician makes fool of himself in sex scandal and lies about it.  Accomplished wife grits her teeth, stands by her man, and waits for her time.  Abedin in 2032!
I wish them well. They have guts and determination and their sticking together shows a very American virtue.
Apparently some people think that so-called chutzpah alone (all negative connotations intended) warrants political advancement.
Very sympathetic story.<br/><br/>The main thing to determine is if he was acting out of character or was the behavior over many years. <br/><br/>If it was out of character, perhaps he was taking prescription medications that lowered his inhibitions. Many common prescriptions have this effect.
I have feeling this Mr. Weiner will get another chance to serve the public office. He is blessed with wonderful wife. Not because she is beautiful or have handle on important figures, its just that she has beautiful mind and courage to forgive people.<br/>May they have a peaceful and happy life.
One, I don't know why Huma ever found this guy attractive. Two, he was wasting time on the job fiddling around on Twitter, Facebook, email and the phone, not doing the work that his taxpaying constituents sent him there to do. Three, he was always known for making a lot of noise, being very publicly confrontational in the political scene, which always seemed like self-promotion to me -- more "I want to be a big-time politician" than "I want to make a difference in our world and my chosen path is politics." He's all about himself. 
Some people will stop at nothing to achieve power, even selling out their family. 
this was a manufactured scandal, in order to remove a progressive voice from the conversation. who Mr weiner shows his junk to is only the business of 3 people, his, his wife's, and the person getting the photo. There was no hypocrisy,as he was not running on some phony "family values" program. <br/><br/>none of the commenters, here on the paid pundits, have any idea what his wife thinks about what happened, or if his behavior is addictive, or anything that is germane to this issue that is anything but germane to his ability to run NYC.<br/><br/>his wife has "forgiven" him, if she even thought forgiveness was needed - i don't know, and neither does anyone else, but them.<br/><br/>Politics should trump puritanism<br/><br/>I would happily vote for mr weiner
I think he fits into the Albany crowd quite well. Considering the state of NY State politics and corruption, Wiener should run with Silver for Governor. I bet you will find plenty of people ready to support him in a run!<br/><br/>Wiener is a self serving egotist with no morals and as such fits in NY politics. Why his wife sticks with him I have no idea, she is a bright, ethical and intelligent woman, the usual victim of the likes of Wieners.
We all make mistakes.  Most can be overcome, some hang around and a few simply go too far.  I think Weiner went too far down a bad road for a politician.  If he had been a school teacher, for instance, we wouldn't even be having this discussion, but because he's a politician, somehow, people are willing to give him another chance.  The same goes for Mark Sanford in South Carolina.  <br/><br/>I don't think these people should be outcasts of society, but I do think that they've blown their chance to be elected officials.  Politicians are typically driven by big egos, rather than a benevolent nature that drives them to do good for society.  They want to be important, popular, recognized, powerful, etc.  Okay, fine, but you also have to be trustworthy and Anthony Weiner is not trustworthy.  His own wife couldn't rely on the vows he took with her.  <br/><br/>So, Anthony, go find something else to do and let another person have a shot at being a representative of the people, no matter how small the office.  Prove yourself in other ways and let those accomplishments wash out your past.
He's way too arrogant for any other occupation.<br/><br/>And way too dumb to serve.<br/><br/>Please let him stay in the hole he dug for himself with his blatant narcissism.
Let's see, he took a picture of his erection, tweeted it and lied about it for awhile. Oh and he did it while he was on the clock and being paid by taxpayers. Right, and none of us have ever posted on FB, sent out a tweet, emailed a friend while at work, on our employer's dime? <br/><br/>If he wants to run I would be more concerned about where he stands on the issues and if he can do the job - not whether he has a good reason for why he tweeted a picture of his privates 2 years ago.
Anthony Weiner was always one of my favorite politicians prior to the scandal. He was true to his beliefs, passionate, and really wanted to make a difference. What he did was beyond stupid. It is hard to get past his lying about it, most of all. I have to say that my attitude towards him was affected in a negative way. But, when I look at the tepid choices for mayor, I honestly would welcome his candidacy. I feel he could do great things for the city of New York.
Anthony Weiner is delusional.  He can't possibly expect to be elected to any public office.  What a creep!  The media should stop  bringing up his name for anything other that his aberrant behavior.
If these two really care about the public, they will go away, stay away, and never bother anybody again.
Are New Yorkers really this gullible?
"Why did she stick with him?"<br/>Well, Abedin grew up in a traditional Muslim family, and she undoubtedly is affected by the view of women as subservient, dutiful, devoted wives and mothers. What Hillary's explanation is, I don't know.<br/>Beyond that, we have come to realize that the level of ethics to be expected from our politicians or business leaders is little to none. This married man, who held office in Washington, sent photographs of himself in his underwear to women around the country, whom he did not know. In the technological world of today, what expectation could he have had that this would not come to light? Of what sort of judgment is this man capable?<br/>The problem is, you can ask the same questions of many state and national leaders. How could the governor make withdrawals and deposits over $10,000 from his bank accounts, for illegal activities, and think he would not be found out? Especially when one considers that, as state Attorney General, he presided over prosecutions that focused on the very same modus operandi? The mind just reels at these lapses of reasoning and judgment.<br/>But there you have it. Short of expelling most of our House and Senate, what is there to do? Let him run. Honestly, Who cares? Does it make that much of a difference who gets elected?<br/>Maybe. But the burden of proof rests on he who thinks so.<br/>Meanwhile, a word of praise for the spectacular gift to the Metropolitan by Leonard Lauder. It restores one's faith in capitalism and society. Bravo!
I don't quite understand the vitriol that is being poured on him in many of the comments today. If his wife can forgive him why shouldn't the rest of us? He did something really, really puerile but compared to many other pols' indiscretions. it didn't add up to much.  
Give him a second chance? Sure, everybody deserves a second chance. If he were my husband or my friend, we'd probably get past it.<br/><br/>But a second chance in an elected office? No. Someone with such incredibly poor judgement -- for the act and for the subsequent cover-up -- does not have my trust to be my mayor, comptroller, or congressman. Saying "I'm sorry" and "I've learnt my lesson" doesn't instill someone with the sense he obviously lacks.<br/><br/>I was a huge supporter of Weiner's. He let me down when he displayed such stupidity. He can win back my respect, maybe, but never my trust.
"Naked ambition." They have cooly analysed their situation and weighed their options.Then came the tears, shared intimacy and carefully calibrated false confidences gamely performed and tolerated to smooth the path for a return to politics and access to all the power and related entitlements they feel so richly due.  They have had their taste of "White House correspondent dinners" and the like and cannot envisage a life without them or seemingly outside the public eye whose validation of their existence and worth they still clearly crave. Not once do they discuss policy and how they hope to make America or the world a better place. No, it's political process as public therapy session and dinner with the Queen. Democracy can be funny at times.
His only qualifications for mayor are his ego and perhaps (in his mind) not having anything to do.  Since his wife is gainfully employed, I would suggest he focus on raising his son and perhaps doing some charitable or volunteer work, but please don't try to get back in the limelight.
The only person in the world who doesn't think of Weiner as profoundly flawed and suspect is the infant son they are trotting out now for these domestic photo ops. And now he wants to spend even less time with him in favor of more hours mimicking the first photo: sharing a table with your wife, on two separate phones, not even looking at each other, trying to impress complete strangers. <br/><br/>Give it up, Anthony. Your kid needs you more than I do, and I'd hope you need him more than my vote. 
These are an awful lot of words about a guy with zero judgement complicated by the<br/>potential loss of $5 milllion dollars that he must use or lose in a race where many<br/>of the candidates will have nowhere near the same financial resources.  It is the<br/>question that should be asked to a man of character, unfortunately, in this case, there<br/>is no man of character.
He ought to repent, accept Jesus Christ as his savior and apply for a job at Fox News. They'd take him.
Just so we are all clear:<br/><br/>Wiener carried out online inappropriate sexual relationships with several women, For years, willingly. He tweeted a photo of his erect penis to a young girl. He did this while his wife was pregnant.<br/><br/>When caught, he denied it. He blamed others, and lied about his twitter account being hacked. He only told the truth when forced to by the media. <br/><br/>Remember that when you hear that this man now wants your vote.
What's the point? Scandal done. Political career should be done.  Time to move on. Yes, disgraced politicians, all over the world, have been rehabilitated, but should they? Probably not.  The average Mary or Joe gets far less and pays far more dearly for a misstep.  Think about someone who has done prison time for using drugs. They are crucified every time they file a job application.  Why should Weiner get a second chance when so many don't?
You have to be, at least, a bit of a narcissist/crazy person to be a politician.  It's all about pleasing people (prom king high school popularity contest at it's best), which can be mostly sisyphean and maddening.  I don't care what he does in his private life or how he spins his shiny new outlook on life, marriage, therapy, or cheeseburgers.  Just get some stuff done. The rest of us are too normal/cynical/practical to run for office.<br/><br/>Great article, though, it terms of entertainment.  We all love a comeback (whether we support it or not), it is excellent fodder.
He was a dedicated and effective politician. His argument for eliminating insurance companies from the health care system was direct and sensible and more honest than the party line. He could give it right back on Fox News. We need smart politicians who know how to perform that very complex job. I was sorry to see him go and would like to see him back. 
It was good while it lasted: his voice was a clarion call to do the right thing in the public arena, he was indefatigable in pursuit of a progressive tack for a political establishment that had leaned rightward for much too long (and still does even more so today), he could be counted on to consult with constituents and to keep his word once given -- this is the Anthony Weiner we knew and admired and supported.  If he had just taken a break or been chosen to serve publicly in an appointed capacity, we would welcome the opportunity to vote him back into office.  <br/><br/>But . . . he shamed himself, breached his public trust by repeatedly lying to the public about a pattern of indiscretion and conduct unbecoming ANY elected official.  <br/><br/>He showed us his least admirable qualities and gave us cause to wonder about his maturity, judgment and seriousness as a representative of and for the common good.  <br/><br/>He displayed a compulsive narcissism that was out of bounds and seemingly beyond his rational capacity to control.  <br/><br/>And we now wonder whether the same self-absorbed narcissism that undid him is subtly still at work in making him think that the mere passage of time and a sympathetic article in the New York Times can somehow launder our consciousness into accepting his re-emergence and possible comeback as the chief executive of this City.  <br/><br/>Much was changed for us by what he did, but not THAT much has changed with us since.  We wish him well in any endeavors not requiring our trust.
There are women out there with his tweets.<br/><br/>Expect to see them if he runs.
From out here in the far west, Weiner seems like the east coast equivalent of Anthony Villaraigosa, a political climber with no concept of self-restraint.  Ralph L. Seifer, Long Beach, California.
Huma for mayor.  Glad that these two have worked things out, hope Weiner's ego is less his concern than social service.  
Excellent portrait of an egomaniac.  Chastened? A veneer.<br/>This is no someone who belongs in public office.  What an offense to New Yorkers to think we would "forgive" someone so clearly narcissistic.  He didn't just "err," he revealed the personality of an addict--in his case, as he states here, he needs adulation.  Huma Abbedin can love him and forgive him all she wants, but the public should not be expected to stand in her high heels.
He better far better off to publish a size of his borrow. His best bet is forget about public service, but get into private business and like the rest of ex politicians mooch off as much as he can, Join a political law firm if he can practice law , become a lobbyists hedge fund manager etc.
One aspect not taken up in this overly long article is religion. I thought Weiner is Jewish. Judging by her mother's name, Abedin is a Muslim. Did I miss something?
Anthony, run! This piece did it for me - I'd vote for you over anyone else on the ballot, if I lived in NYC. Love Huma. Good luck. 
Maybe he should come out and declare that he was bullied as a child, that would put him at the top of the list (the bullied have now surpassed other categores of victims), and all will be forgiven.
Are you kidding - this guy is a jerk!
If New Yorkers are dumb enough to vote for him again, then they deserve a politician like him, at the helm.
I don't care about his personal life. I think he would be good for New York City. He was a good Congressman and I'd like to see him run for mayor. 
The problem with a lack of character is that it is hard to develop in a grown man. He needs to find a different profession.
Please do run for Mayor.  I've been thinking I couldn't vote in this new election and then this story about your courage, humanity and political sophistication showed up.  Like a gift from heaven.  The current candidates all have some good points, but their experience and worldview is pitifully limited. You've learned a tough lesson which we New Yorkers appreciate and trust that you will use this wisdom  well.  I hope you and Huma use your talent, courage and humility to give us what we need in NYC.
I enjoyed the article but was let down as to the real reasons behind the 'downfall' of Weiner.  They are both political animals and have basically closed off their personal lives even within themselves.  I sense that the subject of sex is taboo and note that the couple never did spend continuous time together.  So how good can that intimate relationship really be?
I can't see Weiner winning in the mayoral race with all that baggage.  Plus, I think he could make a more postiive impact by working behind the scenes to raise money and support for critical issues, as well as helping other Democrats. 
Weiner was our congressman for many years. He did a wonderful job and, in my opinion, would make a dynamic mayor.
All he is guilty of is exhibiting highly juvenile behavior. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for political office.   
Man, I miss him not being in Congress. 
I'm one of those who believes Weiner got a raw deal, not just in the press, but also from his fellow Congressional Democrats. When you consider that still-serving Senator David Vitter actually committed a crime and is still in office, it leads you to conclude that a big part of why Weiner had to resign was because he was too inconveniently staunchly left-wing for his more moderate and far less courageous Democratic colleagues. While the GOP lined up in support of Vitter despite his crime, Democrats eagerly threw Weiner under the bus, even though what he did, while stunningly stupid and terribly immoral behavior, was not illegal.<br/><br/>My hope is that Weiner will run for public office again, but I'd like to see him forget about a race for Mayor which he's unlikely to win, and instead run to get his seat in Congress back. As someone who lives in New Jersey and as a trans woman, I believe he's far more valuable to the progressive cause as the courageous Congressman who's not afraid to break with his colleagues to champion the right cause. He may inconvenience Democratic leaders with his uncompromising progressive values, but the truth is that if we're to see progressive values become the laws and values we live under in this country, we need a lot more just like him and Bernie Sanders in Congress leading that charge.
The good news is we know what a naive, self-centered, dishonest, and irrational person Weiner is before he runs for another office.  Let's take that even further: this guy is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, okay?  I pity his poor wife but question why she's still married to him. My guess is they'll be divorced in the next few years.  Fortunately the Weiners are very wealthy and can flit off to Italy or France at the drop of a hat, rent an apartment on Park Ave South when Forest Hills becomes too prickly, and Anthony can take a year or two off during which he eats at his brother's two restaurants and picks up his wife's dry cleaning.  Is anyone going to be sympathetic to this unfortunate after reading this article?  Would even one person vote for him in a mayoral primary? Once again our minds are boggled by the inappropriateness of human behavior.
End of the day he is 'damaged goods'.  Either a Sociopath or Ego maniac based on his behavior in past and present. Not fit for higher office.  Best he can do is stay away from politics and get a life outside of the glamor of public spotlight.
He still doesn't get it.  He doesn't understand or accept the fact that he indulged in Teflon adultery, that he treated the multiple women with whom he committed this adultery as interchangeable objects, that his blind, blistering narcissism makes him unfit to make decisions affecting other people.
What is there to recommend Weiner for mayor other than his ambition and narcissism?.  Weiner has an indifferent education, a record of obnoxious behavior and shameless grandstanding, an ignorance of modern media - or was that just a lack of caring for consequences for abhorrent behavior -and of course being a bald face liar.
Isn't it time that our public representatives to be held to some standard even a low one.    I am sick of this elite group of politicians live the good life on our dime, mess up and then expect forgiveness.  He does not bring that much talent to the tables.  Can't we find someone else.  If the voters still allow this type of a return from ruin we deserve what we get.  I say to him go find a job in some other industry. 
Go Away, Anthony.  I think you could have a great career with Vivid out in California.<br/>If you play your cards right, you might just get the box cover.  Enough
I remember the rage Mr. Weiner showed on the House floor when Peter King and the rest of the Republicans tried to stop the bill that was to provide funding for health care for 9/11 responders.  I felt the same rage and CHEERED when Anthony Weiner stood up for these people who sacrificed their own health in trying to save their fellow New Yorkers.<br/><br/>That act on the House floor is what is important.  So he took a photo of the bulge in his underwear and sent it to someone who wanted to see it.  Big deal.  Can we all move on now and grow up and quit pretending that 50% of the population doesn't have the same equipment in their underwear?  Everybody: pretend you're medical doctors and get used to the idea that "private parts" are commonplace.
He had good policies. A brilliant woman has forgiven him. I'd vote for him.<br/>He could take her last name or use a hyphenated one to make it a bit easier to start over.
This man has no resume? to run anything much less New York. Poor judgement, no work experience, bad behavior, proven liar. Why did The New York Times even run this nothing piece on a little man?
The staged photographs are just so touching.
I hope New Yorkers have better sense than to vote for this self-serving creep.  His wife may have gone from thinking he's a jerk to marrying him, but the public is always going to think of him as a jerk.  If he is intent on serving the public there are a million ways to do so without running for the highest office in NYC.  His name will always be a paragraph away from a dirty joke. New York deserves better.
Seems that glue that held and will hold this marriage together is being in the public limelight at any cost.
I agree, the piece was very troubling in that it revealed to us that Mr. Wiener has not changed at all. He still wants and needs the public to acknowledge him by asking them to forget and forgive what he did and then vote for him. And that might be remotely possible if he dedicated the next several years of his life to something that can help other people overcome their need to seek out strangers(on the internet or otherwise) to stroke their egos. If he had really wanted a 'second chance' he would have decided not to ever run for any political office and spend the rest of his life, devoted to his wife and child, making certain that they are not further harmed by his stupidity. Political ballots should be full of people who have earned the respect of their peers, not people who have had their face in the tabloids for sexual acts. Seriously. 
This man has no shame.  We often do not find out until after they are elected that a politician is a liar, a cheat, and possesses a total lack of good judgment.  We already know all this about Weiner - who in their right mind would vote for him?  I believe in giving people a second chance, but this guy is an arrogant, sex-crazed egomaniac.  He and Spitzer have helped dispel the myth that Jewish men are smart and make good husbands.  As for Mrs. Weiner, she is from a culture famous for treating women badly, so no surprise she has decided to stay with this bum.
The real question should be 'Is he a liar? Is that just part of his character?' Of course, as a politician, he will be in good company if deception is part of his character.<br/><br/>As a husband, his wife must decide that for herself, but the only way to make sure a cheating spouse does not repeat their behavior is to pay back kind with kind. 
Anthony Weiner was an ineffective Congress rep, who made a lot of noise but accomplished little for his constituents. At a time of high unemployment anda stalled economy, I want candidates who address the needs, rights and aspirations of working people.<br/><br/>As for Weiner's mayoral ambitions making the news with a long, "People" magazine style article,  Charles Pierce says it so much better than I could: <a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/anthony-weiner-huma-abedin-scandal-04101" title="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/anthony-weiner-huma-abedin-scandal-04101" target="_blank">http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/anthony-weiner-huma-abedin-scandal...</a>
Well, he sure has the appropriate name recognition.<br/><br/>The idea that the Clintons serve as role models morally for anyone is pretty sad.  But they sure do politically for an ambitious couple whose goals were compromised by one's extremely poor decisions.  What's it called for the woman, cheerful humiliation in service to an egomaniac in the hope that the horse will leave something in the road for you down the line?  He loves his family yet puts them in this position?<br/><br/>Such is the state of modern American politics.  No sense of shame and, in a word, pitiful.<br/><br/>Please do what you can to help the people of NYC, sir.  Go away!
Shame on NYC if you elect this guy to anything ever again. No other folks of talent available for the job?
When Hillary was running for President in 2008, a huge rally was held at a local high school.  From where I stood, I got a perfect view of the care, diligence, and overall hands on approach that Huma had with every detail.  She was pretty amazing--almost as amazing as her candidate.  At the time, I had no idea who she was married to.  It's obvious to me that he needs her a lot more than she needs him.
It's easy to get caught up in the trash talk about politicians' private lives.  Unseemly acts, cover up and deceit.  We have every right to hold them to the highest moral standards. <br/><br/>But as we cavort in this orgy of finger pointing, I would say that the most important measure we must take of their morality is the issues they fought for.<br/><br/>Mr. Weiner was a loud voice for national healthcare coverage, a woman's right to choose, and funds for the first responders to the 9/11 attacks when they became ill.<br/>The list goes on.  He's got a smart and good wife.  Seems to me if he needs a course correction, she's just the lady who will take care of it.  Meanwhile, the country could sure use his voice.
Best wishes to Anthony, Huma and their baby.  I do not know them personally, but I am touched by how they worked together, stayed as a family, and survived their ordeal.  Their story is a lesson on resilience ? doing their best to bounce back even from the most difficult times.  <br/><br/>To err is human; to forgive, divine.  There are valuable lessons that we can learn from Anthony and Huma.  She deserves our respect for taking her vows seriously and rebuilding her family.  Anthony also deserves credit for quickly apologizing for his mistake and asking everyone for forgiveness.  When Huma is willing to vote for her husband, we should also give him a second chance.<br/><br/>Whether Anthony decides to run for office is their joint decision.  I was a registered Democrat in New York.  If I were still there, I would cast my vote, not based on his fateful Tweet, but based on whether he has the ability to contribute, prospectively, to New York and its residents.<br/><br/>If you put any person?s life under the microscope, you will find a few imperfections.  He does not have to be perfect in order to be an effective leader.<br/><br/>Bill Clinton turned out to be an excellent President.  Hillary is still with him.  Clintons are good role models for Anthony and Huma.<br/><br/>Their ability to thrive depends, in the end, on their attitude to their life circumstances.<br/><br/>Look forward to reading another happy story about Anthony, Huma & Son.
Wiener's biggest problem isn't anything he did with his tweets, David Vitter is still a senator after brazening out his prostitution scandal. Wieners biggest problem was lying to everyone on national TV  and in person to try to cover up his embarrasment. It would have been far better for him to say nothing or come clean immediately. Clinton couldn't keep his affair private because Monica could display the dress with the stains on it and the tweets still can be viewed on the internet so before he started lying it's too bad Wiener didn't realize the oppo research is going to be pretty thorough. Glad to see him with his wife and child and I wish him well.
Why do people care so much what our politicians do in their private lives?  He's a guy that actually gives effort for the common man.  He's smart yet flawed.  I'd vote for him.  I want guys that can do thier jobseffectively.  I really don't care what his sex life is about.  
Lying to the public should automatically bar a public official from ever taking public office again.   Is Weiner a person who cares about anyone else?  Could he be trusted to not lie to the public again?  And what exactly qualifies him for the job of a mayor? It seems from the piece that a pathological ego, sense of entitlement, and narcissism are his defining characteristics. <br/><br/>It is saddening to see how public service is not about service but about perks and glamour.  For instance, Hillary arranged to have Huma's parents flown in. A nice gesture, but on whose dime? Can everyone else have help flown in by the government?  Staying at the palace, dinners with the queen...probably not what the founding fathers had in mind for government officials.  
I understand what he did and why he did it.  We all make mistakes- some occur while looking for affection in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>But when we fall down the mountain, we go back up- one step at a time.  We don't try to re-start at the top. <br/><br/>Perhaps Mr. Weiner should start as a public advocate- I'd like to see what he claims he's learned in a public setting.
How interesting.  He, Weiner, is the culprit, yet he and his wife speak of how "We" are recovering from his sophomoric conduct.  They even have an new baby to show off their newfound "we-ness."  Who can forget the scene of Weiner's self-serving confessional, with his sad-looking, distraught wife by his side?  How much of anything, anymore is the real thing?
This whole article is absurd.
PR stunt pure and simple. He could quietly earn his way back but instead is they are trying to manufacture his way back. I used to think less of him, now I think less of both.
Yet, another ego-driven, career-obsessed and self-entitled politician whose shame spiral is used as a launching pad for more unnecessary publicity.<br/>Who is Mr. Weiner's his mentor-- Newt Gingrich?
When a Democrat disgraces himself in this manner, he (usually) has the grace to step down.  When a Republican disgraces himself in this manner, he tends to double down, go for the "Jesus forgives" routine and then stays in office.  Double standard for sure.
The post-scandal playbook.  Apparently, step number one is to pimp out their child in the New York Times.  <br/><br/>These people, both of them, are beneath contempt.
In this article Weiner openly admits to being in politics because he wants people to like him. Now he wants to run again not because he has a burning desire to run (he tells us he doesn't), but because he wants and needs people to forgive him. That, my dears, is the definition of a narcissist and megalomaniac. Nowhere in the article was there anything along the line of, "I care about NYC and I want to see this and that problem fixed and I want to see my city thrive." in fact, precious little was said about the great and complicated city he wishes to lead. No, all we heard was Me, Me, Me, I, I, I. I want to hear from someone who has something to say about this great world city of ours, not about his crotch.
I have a creepy image in my head of Weiner staying up late at night tonight reading every single one of these comments,  including this one, excavating for praise.  (Hey Anthony, don't tweet me please! I have a boyfriend).<br/><br/>Interesting article, very well written.  I agree with others who have commented that Huma should run for something.  She seems like the real deal. <br/><br/>I'm not so convinced that Weiner has much to offer the city of New York.  Seems more to me like he is bored and needs something to do. 
EVERYONE has skeletons in their closets.  Everyone has lied.  Everyone has things they want to keep private.<br/><br/>I could care less what went on in Weiner's personal life.  It was my understanding that he was a politician of the people and that's all that should matter.<br/><br/>It all comes down to our Puritanical prudishness.  Politicians can do a lot of other bad things and we'll look the other way, but anything to do with sex and we freak out.
If I had a choice among politicians who had faced bad scandals, I'd rather have Sptizer.
What page in the post-scandal playbook is getting the paper of record to write a massive magazine article about your rehabilitation process?  
Huma's stuck with him. We're not. <br/><br/>If Weiner wants to win back the public's respect and trust in order to run for mayor someday then he needs to do significantly more. Run a non-profit; become an active and engaged run-of-the-mill NYC city employee; do something good for the world for a few years. Weiner needs to show people through his actions that that he recognizes that he made a mistake and that he deserves a second chance.
There are many qualified, competent and emotionally less compromised individuals who seek to serve in public office. Why do we keep returning to the same old well? Politicians who continuously disappoint continue to be re elected. THAT is the definition of stupidity.
To be clear. I see comments saying she was a defenseless teenager in college. She was neither a teenager nor a "college girl." She is from my hometown, and I have even met her before.
This says it all:  "Their lives have become too small, too circumscribed, too claustrophobic for a couple accustomed to public life."<br/><br/>Too bad.....bring out the violins.
[[?We have been in a defensive crouch for so long,? Weiner said.]]<br/><br/>The comedy practically writes itself.
His personal acts are his business. Electronic entrapment is a recent development that distracts from the bigger issues at hand. He's a smart, effective politician, and if his wife forgives him (remember, she's the one most affected by his blunder, not me, and not you), so should the rest of us.
Strange that she wants to hide her Pakistani background. In my experience, people who run away from their backgrounds rarely make stellar leaders. Own it girl!
Mr. Weiner and Huma Abedin are a truly inspiring couple.  Not only have they rebrokered their marriage, but as it appears, they are rebuilding their missions as individuals, but also as a political unit.  I think Mr. Weiner deserves respect and admiration for his committment towards his family in the past few years; I'm happy to hear he has been getting help.  I look forward to seeing what comes next; go Weiner.
I also don't get why the NYT did this feature.  Will all the mayoral hopefuls get their turn?
Seriously. What does she see in him? That's the real mystery here.
I am really disgusted by the totally hypocritical expectations about the private behavior of US politicians. I don?t understand why politicians are expected to be these upstanding individuals in a country with fairly liberal attitudes to various sexual practices. All he did was sent a sexually suggested image through Twitter. This probably happened because he was really sexually frustrated with his wife being away so much. How is it anyone?s business except for perhaps his wife?  He probably owed her an explanation. Maybe their marriage could?ve been over. But why did it have to cost him his career? At the time when there are so many critical issues really affecting our country, I don?t understand why this is a new story.  
Sorry Mr. Weiner, I am not interested in supporting you for any office. 
If he does come back he's got to change his last name. 
It is fascinating to watch the absolutely intoxicating lure that politics holds for people who crave fame.  Weiner and Abedin have obviously found a very lucrative way to support their family, and could easily choose to avoid any further humiliations, yet they willingly, make that eagerly, subject themselves to this anal-lyzing interview. And, of course, there will be many more to follow, whether the public wants it or not. This alone make  Weiner's  "new man" claim immediately suspect.  As for Abedin, a few sessions with her husband's therapist would quickly reveal that her choosing to marry such a man is by no means an accident. These two are two peas in a pod. 
Weiner did just fine when he represented the Western End of the Rockaway Peninsula and our local paper the Wave staunchly endorsed Weiner for years.<br/><br/>Hey Mark Sanford, the disgraced governor of South Carolina, is pondering a run for a House Seat.  Remember his little hiking misadventure?  He hiked all the way to Argentina so he could have a tryst with his mistress!!!!  So what's the big deal with Weiner running for Mayor?<br/><br/>Does anyone seriously want Control Freak Bloomberg's hand picked successor Christine Quin as our next mayor?
Life imitates art imitates life.....  I know Francis Underwood is behind this...
The electorate is mostly ignorant, has short memories, tends to vote with their heart rather than heads and, in NYC especially, forgives too easily. Saddly, he has a good shot. 
Weiner is a good politician and I would have supported a come back but listening to him in this article I really think he has not come clean. Also I was left with the feeling that the writer didn't probe deep enough. That explanation of why he did what he did was more confusing than anything else. He should have stuck with I was attracted to xyz women who wrote to through social media. I unthinkingly proceeded to write to them and mentally cheat on my marriage with my wife. It finally escalated to my sending the tweet. I am really sorry and I am grateful to my wife for giving me a second chance. I try very hard every day to live up to the faith and loyalty she has shown me. Next he should have told us why he wants to run for any office? Not sure I understand his drive. I guess its nice that it was informal and not planned out but why do I feel like I am being played by a politician? End of the day, he may just be too smart for his own good. 
With all due respect to both men, I think it's important to remember what the consequences were of President Clinton's similar mistakes.  Mr. Clinton's unbounded need to be liked and instinct for denial diverted his presidency from progress to damage control, tarnished Mr. Gore's campaign, and resulted in the election of George W. Bush with tragic consequences. (It is hard given Mr. Clinton's new popularity to remember how toxic he was in 2000 after the grueling affair and impeachment proceeding.) The nation was otherwise in good shape in 2000 so if it hadn't been for Clinton's mistake I think Gore most certainly would have won the Presidency.<br/><br/>In my view, men must realize that holding elected office requires of them the utmost responsibility, integrity, and self-control. Men vulnerable to thoughtless primitive impulses make mistakes that deliver to our opponents the power to defeat us.  The fate of our cities, our states, and our nation is in their hands. 
Yep sex is only a resume enhancement for democrats.   Have an eye for a curvy intern, well you'll get a thumbs up and a okay from NOW.   Need a little pressure release, there is nothing like a high price hooker to do the trick in New York.   If it's been a long hard campaign and your spouse is fighting cancer and is not supporting in the way you think she should, how about a girlfriend.    How about not getting the media coverage your should be getting, well get a girlfriend with ties to the media.    All of these things are okay as long as the little wife at home doesn't complain out loud, you will have the support of all those dems that are suppose to support women.
I absolutely love Anthony Weiner. When he was in Congress he was definitely a force for good. I am really hoping he does get into the race. I am really not a big fan of Christine Quinn she appears to think that the mayor's office is a forgone conclusion. I would certainly be the first to volunteer to work on his campaign. This guy is a fearless fighter.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0ddWf9TQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0ddWf9TQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AG0ddWf9TQ</a>
How can you not feel sorry for Anthony Weiner? He sent the photos in question to his 45,000 followers by accident. Everyone does something accidentally from time to time. But wait! Was the photograph also an accident? Was his intention to send it to a student an accidental intention?<br/>Were his denials to his wife an accident?<br/>This guy fessed up only after there was a mountain of evidence building up against him. He's a low life.<br/>That his wife has suffered and has forgiven him is not relevant to Anthony's fitness for office. Any office.Apart from his perverse behavior he is a liar. 
The way they save their relationship is for him to run for political office?<br/>Sounds like a page from the Clinton playbook.<br/>Everybody knows that couples do unfortunate things during the dissolution of a marriage but this is as problematic as his twitters.<br/>If family and friends care about these people they will urge them to raise their child and stop defining themselves in the NYT.
Don't bother.  Find some other way to serve.
Now that they have been appropriately humbled, I find my hostility toward them has more or less evaporated.  I wish them well.
Anthony Weiner and Mark Sanford should get together and share notes, maybe arm wrestle as to who has the bigger ego.  
He needs to wait much longer ...
Disgraceful. Why give this man who defamed his office and ill-served his constituency this kind of consideration and ink? Good riddance. There is plenty of talent in NYC. Let this narcissist enter the private sector and earn an honest living. Congressman Weiner was my Congressman when I lived in Queens. On the few occasions when he deigned to come into the neighborhoods, he was insufferably arrogant and rude. He argued down working class constituents, dismissed their concerns, like it was a high school debate and he was proving he was the smartest boy in the class. It was impossible to see him in his office, and almost impossible to get senior staff attention, except for the one occasion when they wanted us at a press conference without 24 hours notice. We were fobbed off on very junior staff whose job seemed to be to put us off, since we got nowhere. Congressman Turner was a huge improvement. The current Congresswoman, Grace Meng, is smart, energetic, listens, makes herself and her staff available for serious discussion and research, and is otherwise responsive. 
It wasn't merely that Weiner "went berserk on the floor of the House because a Republican colleague, Peter King, was trying to scuttle the 9/11 health and compensation act."<br/><br/>If I were a member of Congress and a member of the New York delegation was anything but 135% for the act, I too would have gone off the rails if the only reason King was miffed was because he thought the GOP didn't have enough say in crafting the bill.<br/><br/>This is the same Peter King who voted for money for every bill that would help those who suffered disasters like the tornado in Missouri and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.  His primary objective was not to help those - many of whom were his constituents - affected on that fateful day but to have had his party - HIS PARTY! - have more of a say.  Well, HIS PARTY really did its job re Sandy relief, didn't it?<br/><br/>That day in 2010, nearly nine years after the attack on America and after the House had voted against the act, Weiner took to the floor of the House and in under two minutes, became one of my heroes....and I ain't got too many of those.
Everyone deserves a second chance. It took 4 years, but Tiger Wood has gotten to the top again after his scandal. Good luck to Weiner !
Anthony,has shown really poor judgement.<br/>Good judgement is important in a public leader. <br/><br/>I wish him well,but his days as a political representative are over.<br/>Move on !
Everyone loves a chastened politician. Go Anthony!
Masochism or Ego!
Would rather see her as mayor.
let's call this article what it is: a campaign trial balloon set afloat by an ex-politician who just doesn't get it.  what say ye, New York?  do you want this guy as major?  do you deserve this guy?  absolutely not.  read the comments to this article, mr. weiner.  do something else to rehabilitate your image.  find some other way of serving.   as many commentators have said already, "please, just go away".  
He had a tremendous opportunity which he threw away.  Time to give other people, especially those with less of a sense of entitlement , a chance.
Just heard his ego-centric sound bite. How he needs to think about it years from now. <br/><br/>All kinds of concern about himself in the paragraph. <br/><br/>Nary a word about what he might do to serve others. <br/><br/>He needs to find a real job. Volunteer. Learn how to look beyond his vanity mirror. 
She deserves better.
Culturally, people in the US love comeback stories.  Redemption and vindication are powerful social, religious and political themes and this story plays to that.  I think that an elected official should be judged by performance in their job first and their personal issues second.  If the average person, ahem a male person's job or options were affected on their personal indiscretions, we would have a lot of unemployed males.  To that, 'Let he or she without sin cast the first stone.'  MEANWHILE, what can you do for the City of NY, Mr. Wiener?
Who wouldn't run screaming in the opposite direction from a Weiner Run for the NYC Mayoralty?  Any man who disgraced and shamed his lovely wife as Anthony Weiner did shouldn't run for any public office. A tweet is a tweet is a tweet. Stupidity is offensive in a candidate for anything.  Offensive is offensive and what Weiner did (and having the chutzpah to DENY IT!) was offensive.  He should take off the hair- shirt, hug Ms. Huma (who is a real star) and perhaps run a restaurant.
He's the Jim McGreevy of NY. The other clown- raised on the public dime- ends up in a theological school with all the PR attached. He'll be looking to hatch unto some non-profit Church for his livlihood now. Weiner the same. Go get a real job. You are not that special.
" The lies to everyone else were primarily because I wanted to keep it from her.?<br/><br/>Lying in your NYT comeback story is not a good strategy.
Oh how the moral relevant standards spiral ever downward in our thinly veneered society.  Act like a pervert in while in office during 2011, 'fall' as one disgraced from the heights, wait on the QT for around two years, reappear with new plans for public position, give interviews, go on talk shows, and really, 'it's all good'.  Redemption?  abject sense of shame? who needs it anymore, just get back into the scene.  go Tiger, Mark Sanford,  Gov.'AAHHNOLD",  Bubba Clinton, if its OK with People magazine, Oprah approved, if jon stewart can render a joke or two, what the hey, we get to like them all over again.  What was it somebody once said, I believe the gentleman's name was Frederick Nietzsche:  " In individuals, insanity is rare, but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule"
Should he decide to run......he has my vote and financial support !
Lets hear it for a creepy man driven by intense ambition....
Send him to South Carolina...
Does character really count for nothing any more in America?  Does a pervert -- and, yes, the terms is correct in this case -- merit the trust of the people or have the requisite personal qualities to hold the public trust? Let us not forget that he EXPOSED HIMSELF on video and conducted sexual conversations with under-age young women.  Why are we even talking about a comeback for him? The very idea is repugnant.  Why does he merit pages and pages in the nation's newspaper of record -- coverage more suitable in "People Magazine" or the old "National Enquirer?"<br/><br/>I taught this man freshman English a million years ago at SUNY-Plattsburgh.  The only quality I recall was remarkable arrogance -- along with a decidedly mediocre intelligence.  In addition to those traits was the sloppiness that makes for a poor performance in a writing class -- or, as it turns out -- life.  Time to say goodbye to bad rubbish.
".. sex scandal without any actual sex .." Sounds familiar. Deja vu.<br/><br/>Strong Hillary and Huma, done in by weak Clinton and Weiner. What is wrong with them?
But April Fool's Day was nine days ago......
I know I shouldn't care about the sex lives of politicians, but he really bugs me. His behavior was sleazy, crass and creepy. I would not want him to be the principal of my daughter's school, let alone mayor of NYC. I think he's addicted to the power and fame but I don't like him and don't understand why the NYT would give him the time of day.
Weiner was handed the keys to the NY Democratic kingdom by Charles Schumer and still failed.  He is a spoiled egotist, who missed Congressional votes to play hockey.  Like his mentor Schumer he loves to talk and is addicted to power - please stay out of politics. 
I had the experience of watching Anthony Weiner run for office and admired his sheer tenacity and ability to work harder and longer than anyone in politics. I used to go to the local gym and see that he worked as hard in there as well. But, my take is that he never grew up and is still acting out in terms of having never experienced a real life like most young adults. My advice: be the best Dad you possibly can and enjoy your life by helping people in a less ego-damaging profession
I did not know that so many people with impeccable morals and a lifestyle to match (or so they would have you believe) read the NYT and have seen fit to comment on  Mr. Wiener's marriage and career .<br/><br/>I hope Anthony Wiener runs and wins .The real culprits in this story are the founders of facebook and twitter who trap you in their sticky net, get filthy rich and hang you out to dry.
I really enjoyed this article! Everyone makes mistakes! I was touched by their transparency, even shed a few tears when reading about Huma?s Mom and Brother being there for her. I would def. vote for Weiner! I know what?s it?s like to be passionate about something and one mistake can change your life. I say, get back on course Weiner, this is what you?re born to do! #weinerformayor
I don't like the other candidates in the field.  If he runs, I would seriously consider supporting him.  We need a true progressive in the race who will fight for what's still left of the city's middle class.  People make mistakes, and I don't think tweeting a picture of your crotch (although distasteful) should end what was once a political career.  
Character is the most important quality there is, and it doesn't seem to matter anymore.  There is a whole list of talented people that are losers. The list includes Lance Armstrong, Bill Clinton, John Edwards, David Petraeus, Oscar Pitorius, Eliot Spitzer, O. J. Simpson, Tiger Woods, Anthony Weiner, and many others.  Obviously, none of them are that smart as really smart people neither commit cruel acts or harm other people emotionally.   Why can't they just disappear into the woodwork, and stop seeking the limelight?  Maybe then, they can actually humble themselves, and see something other than their narcissistic selves.  Yes, I voted for Clinton the first time but not the next.  You notice how almost all of them on this list are compulsive and pathological liars, also.
I'm a big believer in forgiveness, as long as it's based on reflection, repentance, and humility. Pre-scandal, I liked a lot of what Weiner had to say on issues like health care and justice. I admire Abedin for many reasons. These two hard-driven people seem to be doing the hard work to make their marriage and their family work, to find a core of peace inside together that maybe both of them needed. <br/><br/>Yes it was stupid, what he did. But human. He seems to have genuinely repented. She seems to have made peace with what happened. They've centered on rebuilding their relationship and building a life as parents, together. <br/><br/>If I still lived in NYC, I'd give him a chance at mayor. As an overseas US voter, I'd also give her a chance at being White House Chief of Staff. Which, hopefully, I can do in 3 more years when her boss runs. 
Huma's boss Hilllary's influence is noticeable here.  Overlook the affairs, and save his career!
Only in America do we expect politicians to be as pristine as a character you see on TV (Ozzie and Harriet) or in a book. Grow up people. Adults have gray areas on their lives, don't tell me none of you don't! It is especially absurd to get all riled up about his relationship to his wife. That's their business. Why did he send the Twitter messages? Maybe because his wife is never around and he needed some kind of interaction...does it really matter? <br/><br/>Of course he should run for office. Let the voters decide. Leave the moral policing to the Taliban, stop trying to mimick them please. 
This guy tickles my gag reflex.
Narcissists never disappear they merely regroup. Weiner is the ideal candidate for the times we live in, a time where words trump actions, accountability and reason and shame exists only on the other side of the isle.
This violates the old British political rule: all Conservative (Republican) party scandals are about sex, all Labour (Democratic) party scandals are about money -- for the other way round, it's no scandal.
Not a Weiner Lover, but his offenses pale in comparison to the outright corruption, theft, and bribery we've been reading about in the past 10 days.  Just sayin'
I'll vote for you: in 20 years.<br/><br/>There are so many decent qualified candidates who didn't do all of this; why does he get the right to return to the line so fast? That's not atonement or redemption. It's: "I motion-apologized, waited 12 months, and now it's time to let me have what is mine again. Now."<br/><br/>Serve time before you get what you want: Run for a low office, like dogcatcher. Serve there well. Go to party meetings and hang up posters. Get a better man his coffee. Canvas old ladies at nursing homes for 5 years. WORK your way back: don't expect to claim it back because you're sorry (that you got caught..) If 'saying you are sorry' is all that is required, then there is no way to stop Weiner's.<br/><br/>That you would think to return at all, let alone so soon, shows the utter lack of character you evince. Your wife is a stooge to be a part of this ignoble entry. You both lack a sense of propriety and decency: all about ambition.<br/><br/>If you win, know that in every room you walk, all will mutter what a clown you are behind your back.
Mr. Weiner, please do us all a favor and don't run for Mayor, give up your ambission of running a city, you waffled on weather or not you tweeted inappropriate pics of your privates, we don't need any more whining, lying, pols right now. Get a job in the private sector, don't leech off the tax paying public and we'll all be better off.
One can just imagine this couple plotting the comeback with help from a crew of ambitious spinners..."Hey, I know so and so at the NYT, let's offer them an interview with you two."  Look, this guy was a jerk before we knew he was also a creep. Weiner's self-destruction is no great Greek tragedy; he was a small-bore Queens congressman with an ego way out of proportion to his talents or accomplishments.  Maybe the most annoying thing about this piece is how the NYT allows itself to be used in this transparently contrived public relations effort.  Will the world really be worse off if Anthony Weiner never holds a position of public trust again?
Oh just let it be, Anthony. You do not have to apologize to anyone, except your wife, and she loves you - it is clear.<br/><br/>You have always been a mensch to me. I never thought you were a fake, but just a a fallible human, and that means you are one of us. <br/><br/>So get back in there, and do the people's work. 
In the game of unlooked-for consequences, it now appears that many of us are much more interested in Ms.Abedin than her husband, as a potential public servant.  I wish her all the best in whatever she chooses to do professionally, and personally.
As a Californian, Mr. Weiner, for now, is not my problem.  Before his sexual appetite got the best of him, he appeared to be the Democrat's up and coming air horn.  Our very own Bill O'Reilly.  My distain for Mr. O'Reilly isn't solely based on the content of his words.  He, like Mr. Weiner, is the archetype obnoxious bully.  Is this what it takes to make it in the New York political arena?  If Mr. Weiner's ashes are reconstituted to live again, please keep him inside the city limits.       
I happened to see Governor Spitzer in front of his family's building on East 79th, alone, after the fall. I greeted him warmly and saw his humanity.<br/><br/>It's a tragedy when there is no recovery from some fatal sexual indiscretion. Pity the human male, short of enough blood to run the prefrontal cortex and penis at the same time.
I loved the way he beat up on the republicans. The rest is none of anybody's business.
"Sanford / Weiner 2016".  (Let's assume one of them will switch parties for better odds of winning.)<br/><br/>Now I'm gonna be thinking up campaign slogans all morning for that duo.....
To simply survive the scrutiny of public life, and then, to work for any meaningful progress for the people, success in politics necessitates an unremitting drive to win the game.  Those qualities never exist without a healthy ego, and the truth is that for many men in general (see MadMen), and politicians in particular (except for Richard Nixon), that means a healthy libido as well.     <br/><br/>Americans are such children.  They want their leaders to have the charm of JFK, the political craftiness of FDR, the fortitude of Teddy Roosevelt, but the sex life of Cardinal Dolan.  It doesn?t happen that way. It never did; read history.  If Henry VIII had had a less voracious appetite, England would still be ruled from the Throne of Saint Peter.  <br/><br/>Clinton, Spitzer and Weiner were put to the rack amid the never-ending noise of a self-righteous public tut-tutting about their politicians? wandering members.  But Bush and Cheney, who tortured prisoners to death, who lied the nation into a disastrous and deadly war, and drove the country to near bankruptcy,  are allowed their sordid character without condemnation or comment.  The problem is that the American people assign more value to the stain on a blue dress then to blood stains on the clothes of the innocent or on the uniforms of our fallen soldiers.   The photos of Anthony Weiner are not in the same category as the photos of Abu Ghraib.  Grow up.  
I am amazed to the coverage that is given to this man (10 pages!!) There are clearly many other very competent politicians in NY without his baggage.  And his baggage is disgusting.  I have no desire at all to have it revisited during a political campaign.  Gross!  He does not have a place in politics any longer and should not be treated as such.  There are numerous other stories that far more deserving of coverage.  Please NY Times, this is not newsworthy.
I believe it's worth some kind of article to try to stage this man in a neutral light, but ten pages? That makes me suspicious, and wonder more about the publisher. If it works, it'll be because of the liberal application of his wife's character to the story. Otherwise, he'd be Pee-wee Hermaned.
Weiner should form a club with the likes of Craig and Gingrich and the other congressional bad boys and call it "Redemption Anonymous".
I don't give a crap about his political aspirations, all I hope for is that they really have put their lives back together and found why they got together in the first place, the love and intimacy that hopefully was there, and that this isn't some calculated move to preserve his political career and/or hers. They have a child they obviously love, and hopefully he will grow up in a home where his parents love and respect one another, rather then cling together for expediency sake. 
When they start an Olympic event for Cognitive Dissonance, Mr.Weiner will undoubtedly take home gold, his wife silver, and the NYT bronze.
I read the entire article and did not find any contriteness or remorse in his comments. had he spent all or part of his PAC's $100,000 on something beneficial to the community he served, or to publicly convey his apology, I'd be more inclined to accept him for what he is. But since he hasn't. I'll accept him for what he is: another politician who doesn't get it.
This kind of egotism, public attention and spotlight seeking, especially in context of previously publicized indiscretions by the public servant, verges on mental illness.<br/>Still, Weiner didn't betray the public trust with this behavior, unlike, for example, Eliot Spitzer (for whom I also voted).  I find it criminal that Spitzer actually can show his face, broadcast his opinions (on topics like political corruption!) on national television, and be paid handsomely for it.<br/>Our society is sick, as reflected by the quality of the leaders we choose to represent us.
Sounds like they are making it through and I respect them for that.  I especially admire Huma and I would vote for her.
Based on the article, it seems that the person who dealt with adversity, did not betray the public trust, and balanced work and family seemingly under extraordinarily difficult circumstances was Ms. Abedin.  I care more about her future in public life, including politics, as a result of reading this article.  
I could not care about the private lives of politicians, however a man who sends the picture of his penis  to a teenager is psychologically unstable. Period. This man is emotionally undeveloped. I think New Yorkers deserve better, much better. Please stop writing about this man. It is pathetic.  There must be better qualified democrats out there to represent our interest. 
Weiner can be forgiven for a Clintonian error, as Clinton himself was.
Who would vote for this bozo?  He's such a pathetic creep.  You would entrust him with a position of authority? He can't even commit indecent expoosure without screwing it up.  Beyond the appallingly tasteless photo sending, and the moral ramifications thereof, he was so stupid he didn't realize that Twitter and Facebook are neither private nor anonymous.  I mean, a 4-yr old child could have told him that.  I don't know how a woman could stay with a man who treated her with such disregard and lack of respect, nor any of us vote for someone who is neither repentant nor reformed.  Give it up, Anthony.   
Another limelight obssesed, egomaniacal politician.  Period.  Post-scandal, pre-scandal, same difference.  (Although I did get a kick out of the schtick of the new, improved, analyzed Anthony. Can't wait to see the new Anthony once he's voted in.) Seems like NY has no interest in finding good men.  So knock yourselves out and vote for more of the same.
The Anthony Weiner that I remember is the guy who fearlessly argued for the public option and single payer, even when it became clear that many Senate Democrats were in the pocket of the insurance industry.  I still like than guy.<br/><br/>Weiner clearly has a larger-than-average libido and a larger-than-average need to be sexually engaged, be in virtually or physically.  He has had lots of company in this regard, including former Presidents (Kennedy, LBJ, Clinton) and revered political leaders (Martin Luther King, Ted Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, to name only a few).<br/><br/>Weiner's actions were reckless but personal.  He obviously should have recognized the risk he was running - and then come clean once his tweet went public.  The coverup is always worse than the original crime.<br/><br/>Weiner is a fighter and we need his passion in Democratic politics.  Whether the Mayor's race in 2013 is the right place for that passion is a different question.<br/><br/>In an America in which the little guy gets screwed on a daily basis, Anthony Weiner's virtual indiscretion strikes me as remarkably insignificant. 
Hey Anthony!  Look up fulsome.
I wish he would run for comptroller. Scott Stringer is about as exciting as a bag of flour.
I still remember the week this whole debacle was going on...conservatives were following the blood trail and democrats were making light of it....let's be honest here: the guy basically flashed a college girl over the internet and then lied about it.  Forget conservative or democrat: think about how you would feel if you were this girl's father.  Now take whom he is married to and knows off the table.  Would this person really be a candidate for Mayor of the most powerful city in the world?  No, he'd be a guy Chris Hanson asked if he brought the wine coolers.
I very much wish men would not talk about women like this. It is beyond insulting, yet they think it is a compliment.<br/><br/>Her husband: '...It?s not like she?s this lightweight beautiful person in fancy outfits. She?s like this intriguing, fascinating creature...'<br/><br/>And from the reporter: '...She was sophisticated and glamorous..'<br/><br/>Here's how you determine what is acceptable to say about a female politician...ask yourself if you would say the same thing about a male politician and if not, do not say it.
Weiner's calling was "......to be a problem solver." Some advice to Weiner is to get a career in simple mathematics. You have problems in the public sector.
Haven't we already seen enough of this loser? Why on earth would I want to trust him in a position of responsibility or hold him up as a role model for our youth. Think again, people!!
To me his face will forever look like the content of his infamous  picture.
Of course he should run if he wants to.  We are all free to become candidates. But  frankly, he is too creepy to vote for.  Unless he can demonstrate that he has some mental disorder that he has successfully treated--and the article does not convince me of that--why would anyone vote for someone who sends sophomorically sexual pictures of himself to strangers?
A life long New Yorker and in Weiner's district. I liked him then and he's ok by me now. The only thing I care about is NOT electing Quinn!!!! We do not need another Bloomberg in office... oh, and  I'm a gay woman- the fact that she is also has NO bearing on my choice!!!!
And, just what is this man doing to "redeem" himself?  Planning another run.  How about he does something constructive, even volunteering, and learning that there's a lot more to life and " public service" than meeting his own needs and desires.?<br/><br/>For that matter, what exactly are his needs?  They certainly don't include self-knowledge because if they did he'd wonder a bit more about  why he was so attracted to unmet 21 year-olds in the first place and not merely focus on the availability of social media's facilitating the contact.  And, he should also examine why he lied for so long instead of writing it off as foolishness.  This bodes ill for his personal as well as his political life and for whatever professional life he might make if he exits politics.  Oops.  What would that be, by the way?  The article says nothing about his educational background or any job other than Congressman.  I don't know a thing about this man other than his obsession with himself and politics from reading it.  Thank goodness, I no longer live in NY and have to put up with him if he does run--and hopefully loses.
Anthony just go away.  Enjoy your life as a consultant and leave the rest of us alone.
And, the NYTimes needs to devote This Much time and research on that man (10 pages!)....WHY???? It is obvious by the comments here that your readers simply are not interested, and I think we can all name many - MANY - far more pressing items requiring such attention, given the current state of affairs in this country. 
Sounds like he still has problems that getting elected wouldn't fix, and that some sort of repeat would be waiting to happen if he ever returned to public office.
Leave it to those smart New Yorkers to actually elect anthony weiner to office again just like Rangel and dozens of others who disgrace your city and state. <br/><br/>New Yorkers think they are smart and intelligent, yet look who they have representing them in city, state, and federal offices and I would argue otherwise. <br/><br/>It is truly sad, how far we have fallen from the likes of Teddy and FDR. <br/><br/>NY will get what they vote for and I hope they get it hard.
Consider Weiner the politician:<br/>He stood up for 9/11 first responders.<br/>He was against selling arms to Saudi Arabia (15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia).<br/>He was an advocate for Medicare. <br/><br/>I loved it when he went on Fox "News" and ate those "journalists" alive and left nothing but their bare bones.  <br/><br/>"Weinergate" was not a case of illegal sexual activity or hypocrisy, as with Republican Senator Larry Craig, who built his career on ?Family Values? and then was busted by the cops cruising in an airport men?s room. As well as other ?Family Values? cronies like David Vitter and Mark Foley.  Or Eliot Spitzer (Client 9) who ferociously prosecuted prostitution cases before he was governor.  There was no lying under oath like Bill Clinton or allegedly illegal payments like Ensign or Edwards.  And Weiner didn't even have actual sex with any of them (see Bill Clinton for a better definition of this).
You lost me at "kvelling".  All too cute, too cozy, too precious to be anything but a bald, barefoot plea for us to forget his creepiness.  And why the NYT wasted so much space on him/them is beyond me, was beyond me; I couldn't finish it  [if I wanted to keep my breakfast down].
Not living in N.Y.C., I couldn't vote for this guy if he runs for mayor. If I did live in N.Y.C, would I vote for this guy ?  Are you kidding me ? He may reach redemption at some point in time, but N.Y.C. deserves a grown-up, not someone who is still trying to figure out who he is from his therapist.
Finally, Anthony, you get a does of your own medicine: people berating you, calling you on the carpet. We found out just how small a man you really are, in more ways than one. Change your name, move to the wide open spaces, and Tweet away into obscurity.
<br/>Huma Abedin for Mayor; Wiener? Childcare and home care. Why overlook the obvious talent in the family just because she doesn't have a penis?
?Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work? is an incredible book that everyone must read to understand people in public office like Anthony Weiner? My question here is: why his wife takes such psychopathic punishment? Perhaps low self steam, money, fear of solitude, or is she just sycophant worshiper? (Maybe all of the above)<br/>I?m stunt to see the NYT paying attention to Weiner as they have done this with so many other sexual-egomaniacs?
Beautiful moment with Abedin on the plane, with everyone continuing on the project as if the tears weren't flowing.<br/><br/>Three things stand out in this article. One is his great vocabulary. Another is that he made no plan about how he wanted to talk about his past for this interview, which doesn't bode well for someone who wants to be mayor. And Weiner gives no reason why he would do a good job as mayor. He will have to be passionate about what he brings to the table and why New Yorkers should think he would be the best person to lead the city.<br/><br/>I liked his wife in this interview. And he seems like he's grown as a person and that he cares about her. It sounds like he still needs to do some reflection on what motivated him to engage with people in that way. It could just be a playing out of a fantasy life, without a thought about the consequences. (The second part is what he needs to look at, but the mind is famous for shutting off during sexual thoughts or actions.)<br/><br/>AND he needs to get a better diet. He's headed for Bill Clinton territory with the one described in this article!<br/><br/>Good luck to them both.
I cannot agree more with the wise words: ?at the end of the day, at the very least, every woman should have the ability and the confidence and the choice to make whatever decisions she wants to make that are right for her and not be judged by it.?<br/>However, Ms Abedin?s first impression was correct. He?s a jerk.
Why is that even made public!, it is only gossip about some body I never even heard about?  Are they murderes? Are they thieves? Are they wealthy type of swindlers  hiding their money in foreing countries so they won't have to be taxes? That  should be informative issues  for the readers .
Oh please!  <br/><br/>I don't care how many cute baby photos they put this creep in, I would not vote for him if he were the last candidate on earth!<br/><br/>He's a nasty man and indecent to boot!<br/><br/>No way!
Why doesn't the Times leave this sort of politically rehabilitative puff piece to People magazine?  <br/><br/>c
He did something really stupid.  A lot of men do stupid things when sex is involved.<br/>Let's all get over it.  He's probably a better man now having had time to reflect.<br/>Think of some other politicians and their actions.  What he did is so minor.
Unfortunately, this incessantly long article has provided Mr. Weiner the attention and stage he covets and the platform for his mayoral campaign.  This ?get the dirty laundry aired out in advance and ?been there done that, can?t touch me? ploy is pathetic.  <br/><br/>This is yet another example of zero accountability and lust for power that provides ample reason to cancel my NYTimes subscription.  Stop with star search for the disgraced retreads and uncover the people actually making a positive difference.
This isn't journalism, it's public relations and if Jonathan Van Meter doesn't understand this, his editors ought to make the necessary corrections. <br/><br/>Point to remember: Mr. Weiner who famously bullied the weak, when stronger men and women watched his back, and a toadied to those stronger figures, did not merely send "lewd" or silly images by text. When the man was found out, he lied, lied again, called press conferences, suggested his account was hacked and also, threatened to have the FBI investigate.<br/><br/>The man is an opportunist and counting on New York City's reflexive turn toward Democrats and people's increasingly short memories. It is a shame that this obviously disturbed individual is enabled by Van Meter and the TIMES, who define the "scandal" as a matter of bad judgements for reasons only Jill Abramson and the Sulzbergers.
He comes across as a self centered jerk. I wouldn't vote for this guy to be dog catcher. I got news for you Anthony, post scandal, you've still got, what your own brother referred to pre-scandal, as a certain air of "douchiness".<br/>And it's not the scandal, that I can understand, dude's wife was gone all the time. It's his personality in general. 
Run for mayor? No. Don't.
Before I spent a summer interning on Capitol Hill, I was rather indifferent to the occasion Congressional sex scandal -- having worked there however opened my eyes to the damage caused in such incidents that doesn't get any sort of attention. My supervisor told me about a friend how had lost her job because the senator she worked for didn't get reelected - this is a foreseeable risk when working in politics; what positively incensed me was the fact that she thought that she had gotten a good break when she found a new job in Congress... on Representative Weiner's staff -- needless to say when his thoughtless affair became headline material and he resigned, she found herself out a job once again in the lower dip of the recession. Weiner was shortly making the circuit on talk shows but she,( and all of her cooworkers), was once again jobless though no fault of her own..  From my estimate based upon working in a different office, Weiner's affair cost between 10 and 15 people their jobs.  These are civil servants who work very long hours, in a very stressful job, with very little play, are constantly held as scapegoats for "government bureaucracy bloat" and subject to pay cuts and firings for aimless budget reductions resulting from some politician wanting to make a soundbite.  When working in politics you know that your employer can lose and set you out of a job. But you should not EVER need to fear losing your job because some of some politician's selfish indulgences.
I believe in redemption.  But, Mr. Wiener might need to seriously consider the way he has in the past responded to the intensities of public life.  He needs to take it very slow and to reflect upon the dangers of ambition for a guy like himself--and for his wife and their child.   Their story is not uninteresting, although I wonder if it deserves the space it is given in the NY Times Magazine. To both the NYTimes and the Wieners I would say:  "Too Soon."
Good, bad or indifferent we've turned our politicians into celebrities and as a result our country has suffered immensely. Weiner's mea culpa may be sincere, but it's still cleverly crafted scripting intended to get him back in the game and refects the depth of mediocrity inherent in our political establishment. As our country flays about trying to extricate itself from the Great Depression II-the Sequel I think we need to stop going to the same "watering hole of diminishing returns" for political leadership and engage with ourselves in a more "populist" grassroots fashion to remedy our country's many ills. A second chance for Weiner? Why bother, it really doesn't matter.
I got a poll call yesterday -- but it was very indirect about Wiener.  First there were a bunch of questions about rating the other candidates.  Then the last question was who would I vote for and Wiener was in that list, though he hadn't been in the earlier questions. I asked the questioner if he'd left something out because the final list was different!
Two points:<br/>1.) I hope New Yorkers will give this man a second chance.<br/>2.) Anthony's a good brother, eating at his brother's two restaurants with a NYT reporter. He milked it.
As much as I have come to dislike Weiner and his narcissism, I have to admit I have very recently found myself wondering if he should enter the race -- all others vying for the Democratic nomination have been so disappointing.  Chris Quinn has been a huge disappointment, shrieky and unable or unwilling to be very clear about what she stands for.  And I don't think any of the other current Democratic candidates have a good chance of beating the Republican candidate, assuming it's Lhota. <br/><br/>I believe Weiner has until June to make a decision and suggest he wait, if not until then, at least a bit longer.  If Chris Quinn continues to drop in the polls, and Lhota goes up, people may beg Weiner to enter the race.
Good for them.  Everybody deserves a second chance.  Especially his wife.
He was a great congressman and would be a great mayor.  Everyone deserves a second chance.
forgiven....   run anthony, run!!!!!    please... 
I was never a huge Weiner fan, but the fallout of this scandal should have been confined to his marriage.  Abedin had every right to feel betrayed and to take whatever measures she felt were necessary to correct their relationship.  <br/><br/>But as for it reverberating through his political career?  Please.  Who cares.  It was an x-rated chat session on the internet.  It was made into an H-bomb because of right-wing media distortion and America's pathetic, borderline-Medieval Puritanism about sex.  <br/><br/>It's not that big a deal.
Male of the species:  "Nothing I do is in my own control. . .it's just a male thing. . . we (guys) understand one another and we forgive him. . .in fact, we admire him. . .  <br/><br/>Female of the species:  "Give me a break. . .why would anyone vote for someone who claims they are out of control. . .have you no shame?. . .women are more prone to voting than men. . .VERY few women consult their male significant others with regard to their franchise choices. . .(McDonalds or Politics).<br/><br/>There you have it. . .the bottom line rationale is that women make better choices when they are in power.  This is NOT hard to understand, but it seems to be hard to ACT accordingly. <br/><br/>VOTE for candidates who mirror your values and your better angels.  <br/><br/>Remember Mellancamp's refrain: "This is OUR country!"
Honestly, after reading this lengthy article, I still have no greater understanding of why Mr. Weiner did what he did. But  I commend the difficult and painful work he and his wife have done to rebuild their marriage and their lives.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it appears that politics - or political ambition -  may not bring out the best in Mr. Weiner. There are many other ways to make a difference in the world, perhaps he should explore some of them for the sake of his family and his own well-being.<br/><br/>And stay away from social media; for some people, it is clearly toxic.
I don't hate Weiner, don't care about what he did. However, the stupidity of what he did disqualifies him in my view. We are surrounded by stupid, corrupt individuals in office. I think it's time to raise the bar. This is New York. There are plenty of smart people around. I can't stand machine-politics Christine Quinn, who sold her soul to the devil of Bloomberg. But Bill deBlasio seems a decent, honest, hardworking guy. Weiner should get over himself and do some penance. Work for deBlasio, for the people of New York. We aren't ready for the arrogance and hubris of a guy who sent pictures of his crotch. Not to mention that it's just plain pathetic that in this media day and age anyone can think they can get away with stuff like that. My son understood that at 9.
I'm sure Mr. Weiner appreciates your free assistance in his re-branding campaign.  Now he's a sensitive new-age guy.  But still an obsessed narcissist.  Must be what makes him a good politician
What turns me off about Anthony Weiner is not his previous lewd behavior, it is - and it seems to be common to most, if not all politicians - that arrogance, that pride, that overweening self-importance that somehow we just can't do without him.<br/><br/>These guys just have to make a comeback.  Does he not understand that we did not miss him?  That we do not need him?  That there are others who can do the job?
I'm reminded daily that the Times does some of the most important work that any institution can do. And then I see something like this. And all that respect just evaporates.
I don't know if it's narcissism or just pure chutzpah that makes Weiner think he should run for mayor. Maybe it's both. But he should stop right now. Go away. He doesn't need to live in a cave for the rest of his life, but he apparently has not learned anything from his downfall. 
It doesn't seem as if Weiner needed to spend money to test the waters for his return-<br/>all he needed was a front page article to do it for him. <br/><br/> They're not the Clintons. Let Weiner find another career that doesn't keep him in the spotlight.
Just Do It!
The City Council slush fund is a bigger scandal, so why shouldn't Weiner run? After considering the current crop of candidates -- almost all of them career politicians -- I think Weiner's presence could make the debate more substantive. In 12 years, Mayor Bloomberg has pushed the city budget from $44 billion to $70 billion, and the Independent Budget Office predicts the next mayor will inherit a deficit, made worse by federal budget cuts. Bloomberg may be competent -- not a small thing -- but he loves corporate welfare, and his agenda has depended on it. The cost of living here is extremely high, and poverty is a big problem. Meanwhile, the schools are still a mess. No one is talking about what comes next. If Weiner starts talking about the future of New York City -- remember his 100 "new ideas" in 2005? -- then I might even vote for him . . . might.      
I was most surprised to learn from this article that Weiner did not have any actual sex affairs (if that is true). I always assumed that the bizarre twitter pictures were just the tip of the iceberg and that this guy probably had more girlfriends than Tiger Woods.<br/><br/>After reading the article I do feel sympathy for the man. What no one can really know of course is whether he has truly changed or is just acting it. But I think I could vote for him on policy grounds.
Stupidity like his cannot be tolerated in an elected position.<br/><br/>Obviously he's bored and misses the attention, but what will his brain tell him to do when he's feeling validated again?<br/><br/>We don't want to find out.<br/><br/>Weiner, please go away. You obviously have money coming in from somewhere. Relax and take care of your baby.
How does even think he can seek redemption at this point?  Did he do something meaningful in the years since he resigned that he deserves a second look? Now, he seems to be saying, well I have sat on the sidelines long enough so I deserve a second chance.  That does not seem like penance to me.  It is really a disgraceful attempt at a comeback.  Jim McGreevey deserves a second chance, he has counseled prisoners and done things since a scandal drove him from office.  What has Weiner done to deserve a second chance?  Nothing he said convinced me.  Stay away, Mr. Weiner.  
It shouldn't have been a scandal, although that it became public may have been the best thing for him and them as a couple. Smart, personable, powerful men become so smug and end up rationalizing so much. I wish them both well. And I hope he runs.
Why was the question not asked of the Weiner's as to how they were currently supporting themselves?  Is he getting a pension from theCongress?  Is she getting money from the Clintons?  They are living in one of the more expensive areas of New York.
It seems clear from this article that Anthony Weiner doesn't know who he is quite yet. He still lives in a world where he and his wife inhabit a space he calls "Camelot" where actions and consequences have an unusual and not necessarily causal relationship. He seems addicted, if anything, to an idea that he should be a politician, that he has moral weight or authority.<br/><br/>The problem with his scandal was not that it was morally reprehensible, or illegal. It was that he, as a husband and father, broke his trust with another human to whom he had legal, spiritual, and moral obligations. There are plenty of intelligent, moral, faithful and responsible people who should stand for political office in these trying and distracted times. Weiner has proven (and not disproven, especially in this article) that he is untrustworthy as a custodian of the public weal.<br/><br/>He's a human being, and a father, and I hope that he finds a satisfying way to fulfill the obligations he has to his family and also to himself. He should stay away from politics. He should have the decency and maturity to accept that a life of public service is unsuitable for someone of his character.
I am not a New Yorker, but seems to me that Huma would be the better choice.
Nice try. <br/><br/>But we don't care if you're a horny guy, if your sexting was a little weird, or whether you love your wife. We don't care if "the men in our family don?t hug each other" or if you "just wanted people to like me." None of that stuff has any bearing on what kind of public servant you are. <br/><br/>What really does matter, and what this article barely touches on and you seem to want everyone to forget about, is your dishonesty. Sending naked pictures over the internet may have been a "dumb mistake" that you "just didn't think about," but handling it by completely lying to the public was something that you DID think about. You weighed the pros and cons and decided "I'm going to totally lie to my constituents," even though there was a significant likelihood that the facts of the situation would come out. That says something to voters about your character, and it says something about your judgment. I think we deserve someone better for mayor.
I am less worried about Weiner running for office,  then I am about the mayoral choices voters in New York City will have.
I can distil this down to two issues: 1. Wiener did something sexually explicit (not even very) and in this screwed up country - where 3 year old girls sexualize themselves with lipstick because of influence by capitaliistic ads to sell products - where everyone oogles sex but then recoils from it AND 2. Wiener lied many times about the incidents and continues to lie to himself that he does not have a problem with sex addiction (and perhaps other addictions) because of the shame around the issue of sex.  Where is the real transformation? Where is the deep work, like that an alcoholic goes through and comes out the other side?  I agree with one reader who said that this is just a grab for power... and politics is basically that: POWER. And Wiener, as well as most all other politicians are addicted to this power and cannot let go of it once they get it.  It's like celebrity... walk into a room and have the masses fawn all over you - of course it's addicting.
Sorry, but all the puritanical hypocrites need to lighten up and review the record.  Compared to many in the house or senate, Weiner was an effective advocate. He certainly didn't seem like a person who needed to run for office in order to self-actualize to his/her lofty ambitions (see Hillary Clinton, Mike Bloomberg, Mitt Romney, etc.) He fought the fight on behalf of his constituents.  The fact that the dems don?t have stronger advocates like Weiner on their side has contributed to the gridlock in congress.  He didn't have sex with an intern. He didn't take a rent controlled apartment at below rate prices or fail to pay taxes, didn't have a child out of wedlock, and didn't invade a foreign sovereign on fabricated intelligence.  Regarding his ?dishonesty?, really - what the ____ would you do? If Weiner were to run again I would donate my time and money towards his effort. And yeah, I feel the same way about Elliot Spitzer. Our best advocates are sitting on the sidelines.
It's interesting how the NY Times had an article a few weeks ago about leading mayoral candidate Christine Quinn putting her in a bad light...also about an issue of self-control.  ("In Private Quinn Displays a Volatile Side"; March 26, 2013 NY/Region)<br/><br/>The Times must have known at the time they were also publishing this10 webpage mea cupla of Anthony Weiner.
Something tells me this man should quit while he is ahead - he has an accomplished wife who loves him, a healthy and happy son, an ability to live on Park Avenue despite being a stay-at-home dad, and a supportive extended family. If he has a passion to help the citizens of New York (after all, isn't that the "true" motivation of politicians?) then he can certainly do so without running for something. There are many people who do great things far from the limelight. Or, is it the limelight that this man really craves?
It would be better if Huma would run for mayor.
Where did they get the money to rent a spacious prewar apartment on Park Avenue South?  He was unemployed and she was working as an aid to the Secretary of State, which I assume is not a high paying job.  Did he reach into those political campaign funds he still has?  I assume that they would have had a difficult time making the 40-50x monthly income requirement for renting most apartments in NYC so did someone give them a sweetheart deal or did someone like his brother sign for them?
He doesn't have a burning desire to run? Then why expose his family like this, and in the other tabloid articles? <br/><br/>Because he's still, at heart, a liar. 
Come back Anthony.......we need you.  All is forgiven
I cannot imagine he is going to win.  I would really prefer he not subject the public to this all over again..  Honestly the whole story makes me uncomfortable to the point that I can't even read the article - and I'm in my 30s.  Pls instead continue to work on yourself, and do some type of work that does not require your being in the public eye. Consider a name change. 
I'm appalled at the shameful arrogance of politicians like Weiner (Spitzer, Sanford, etc.) who, even while they are falling from grace and speaking all the correct mea culpas to the public, are shamelessly engineering their return to self-serving power. Like many others in this country I believe in redemption, and would certainly applaud Mr. Weiner's attempts at atonement if he would reinvent himself in any field other than politics. But it is clear from this article that, despite the profound public embarrassment and hurt he caused his family and his constituency, Mr. Weiner has not learned humility. Nor has has he changed one iota from the driven narcissist who once coveted the Mayor's office--and is now taking advantage of the public's natural willingness to forgive the rich and famous their trespasses in order to assuage his bruised ego and gain some kind of vindictive triumph. 
Anthony Weiner's "overweening ambition" in the first paragraph was a little cutesy but maybe coincidental and not deliberate.<br/><br/>I hope we have more to choose from than Weiner and Quinn. Personally I'd like to vote for Ms Abedin.
Weiner says it's maybe now or never for him after less than 2 years...how about for the rest of us?   He put the Country thru the worst of stories as a US Congressman...no morals and personal ethics.  As a native New Yorker, I say 'no way' New York!  Let's keep the personal standards bar up for our elected officials and for New York City.  NYC deserves the best in personal leadership including character.
Who would vote for this bozo?  He's such a pathetic creep.  You would entrust him with a position of authority? He can't even commit indecent expoosure without screwing it up.  Beyond the appallingly tasteless photo sending, and the moral ramifications thereof, he was so stupid he didn't realize that Twitter and Facebook are neither private nor anonymous.  I mean, a 4-yr old child could have told him that.  I don't know how a woman could stay with a man who treated her with such disregard and lack of respect, nor any of us vote for someone who is neither repentant nor reformed.  Give it up, Anthony.   
"Made a mistake"?  He showed terrible judgment....his behavior, at best, was teenage-level.  And this is what passes for leadership?   It's not like the guy is applying for your run-of-the-mill job.  I truly do not understand why elected public officials are not held to a higher standard.  
Doesn't this all just go with the territory? If not Weiner, then some other power-hungry egomaniac? <br/><br/>Why we invest so much faith in these creatures, gobbling up the pr and all the empty, recycled, unrealistic false promises, year in and year out, despite the fact that business as usual always prevails, is the question we need to be asking ourselves. Until we get wise and start taking responsibility for our own behavior, not expecting some white knight to come in and save the day, we will get exactly the "leaders" we deserve.<br/><br/>Politics, yechhh.
Really, do we need to allow another navel-gazing phony back to the trough just because he has done the requisite "penance"? Why don't we wake up? I hope New York voters are smarter than he seems to think they are. 
He (and she) has gotta be kiddin'?! What do they take us for?! Bigger fools that we (the electorate) appears to be?
I would take Weiner, warts and all, if given a choice between him and the corrupt, inane, stupid, racist or otherwise useless Republicans who currently staff our Senate and House of Representatives.<br/><br/>The fellow has personal problems that apparently never interfered with the excellent job he did as a Congressman.<br/><br/>Compare this with the sordid world of the radical right wing who are determined to squeeze the poor, the middle class, and those who labor for a living so as to provide more wealthy for the ultra-wealthy.<br/><br/>A bit of perspective is in order.  Weiner should definitely be back in politics representing his share of the 99%.
I'm a Democrat but...<br/><br/>Weiner / Quinn...<br/><br/>Weiner / Quinn...<br/><br/>I can't decide who I dislike more...
I wouldn't be asking Ms. Abedin about Mr. Mom. She's the one with experience working alongside Hillary Clinton and weathering the storm of both the Clintons' and her own marriage. In my book, she's the one with the political upside. "Huma, how YOU doin'?" 
So, the best that NYC can come up for Mayor since 9/11 is an endless selection of wealthy bullies?    No wonder America has fallen out of love with you. 
Having quickly skimmed through the many responses to date, I believe Mr. Weiner should have asked the NYT to run this piece before he spent $100K on polling. The responses here should probably give him the answer he was looking for.  I'm guessing he should look for some other way (in the short term at least) to fulfill his need to serve the public interest.  Maybe he could volunteer his time to help those less fortunate...
This is a typical example of what our political leadership has become.<br/><br/>The lack of true ethical leadership in this country is shocking. Its all about these poiliticians selfishness and narcissim. It has nothing to do with serving the public interest. This the nation we have now. A total absence of good role models and leaders. When you have guys like this one and Mark Sanford thinking that their lack of moral compass has actually become an asset ocertime and that they can come back to public office. Its just incredible to me that people even give them a voice.<br/><br/>If there is any hope for this nation in the near future we need to absolutely be persistent and unwavering in our uncompromising demand of true, ethical leaders!! We need to without question send all these deviants into obscurity for the rest of their lives and never give them a voice. <br/><br/>I know someone may say that we are all humans we all make mistakes and deserve another chance and I agree with that! But NOT when you are a leader in public office.  When you are a public leader you are suppose to be an extraordinary example of human dignity and integrity. Gentleman if you do not have these qualities do yourself and us a favor and never come back . Please fade into whatever it is you do by yourself and allow the true leaders of men to come forth.
After reading the article, it does not seem like this man learned very much from his past mistakes.  It sounds like he might repeat his mistakes again but hide them better this time.  
Mr. Weiner's return to the public stage would bring great relief to one segment of the population which has suffered terribly in his absence: the producers and show hosts of MSNBC.  Things have not been the same without his daily commentary. 
He's still a narcissist, obviously -- loves to talk about himself.
Some people just don't know when it's time to disappear into private life. He should sell real estate or something.
To err, is human, to forgive, is divine, to forget, is recklessness. Let him earn his keep without the taxpayer's having to foot his bill, or does he plan on having us butter his toast forever. I do wish him and his family well but please Mr. Weiner stay away from my well.
I'd find it hard to trust the judgement of anyone who ordered escargots with a cheeseburger. 
It's never the crime, people. It's the cover up. To err is human, to cover up is cowardly, dishonest and just wrong. That's why I will never vote for him.
This story was many pages too long. I feel sorry for him but I wouldn't vote for him. He needs to find a job where private, juvenile behaviour doesn't matter--unfortunately, politics isn't one of them. Maybe working in his brother's restaurants would be a good start? 
He is what was called back in the day, a pervert.  If there was no internet he would have been wearing a trench coat and flashing woman on the subway.
I hope he runs and I bet he does well.  He was always on the right side of the issues, is smart as a whip and is easily better qualified than the ho hum field out there.  Do we really want Quinn, Mike's hand puppet?  That would be Bloomberg IV.  thompson, liu, de blasio, nice enough, but nothing major there.  and Llota?  Um, no, thank you very much.  <br/><br/>Weiner's got the NYC brash thing down.  I think he's viable.  And, based on the competition, i'd vote for him right now.<br/><br/>For those worried about his "ego" please look at the field: no shrinking violets there, and that's for sure.
Run for mayor.<br/>And, please be open and honest about being a male in politics.  Your male hormones clouded your judgement. I suspect this goes on in great and small ways with other men in the political arena, all over the world.<br/>Its about time this double-standard was turned around on men.<br/>The world at times seems drunk and sick on testosterone. It has its place but this 5000 year  Dionysian celebration has given us a world completely hostile to women and to itself.<br/>If you think and lead from the perspective of being in a woman's shoes (always) you will be fine.  Be responsible almost completely for your child's care like most every working mom. Let this perdpective inform your policy making decisions and your tweets.<br/>I belive the future will eventually be green, cooperative, and sustainable rather than continuing on this destructive egotistical short-sighted self serving style of politics and governments and economics. 
I'm stunned at what appears to be the lowering of standards by my fellow NYers. I am a democrat, but think for a minute about what this guy was doing "while he was in office" the last time around. He was supposed to be focused, at the very least during office hours, on his duty. Wasn't the case. 
Why do they come across as so creepy and disingenuous in this article?  What would qualify this guy as Mayor of NYC? 
I do not see Wiener with any experience running a city.  We do not need a celebrity mayor.  There are many good candidates experienced with the city.  I have no confidence that Wiener cares about keeping people safe.  Its all about him. 
With such a beautiful &amp; talented wife,why you have let yourself down? Be a family man &amp; good public figure for Mainstreeters. You have god given passion &amp; fiery speech to be a public voice &amp; just concentrate on that. Well come back &amp; wish you both happy married life &amp; energy for serving people to your fullests. 
We both know for a fact that your kid will eventually be shown those pictures of his own Dad, published on the Internet, torso naked, in boxer short, and with a big e....n.<br/>I would be horrified and betrayed by my own father posing on the Internet. I'd be in tears...
I once was a big Weiner fan,<br/>I don't think that once more I can<br/>Put hopes on the table<br/>For one so unstable,<br/>Weiner is no longer my man.
Since they are testing the waters, I'll give them my opinion. I would not vote for Anthony Weiner for Mayor. His outsized ego, lack of common sense and the silly lie he tried to pull off not only with the public but with also with his wife make him unqualified in my view. <br/><br/>I'm sure there is something else he can find to do with his life maybe even continue to be a full-time parent to his son. His wife seems to have a great career ahead of her. 
I trully hope this man will not insult the public by running in 2013!<br/>If he had a daughter, would he like her to recieve explicit photos of middle aged man's private parts and then have that Very man run for public office a posittion that is meant to help and protect  the public?  What a joke!<br/>Stay out of politics Mr. Weiner but do keep up with your shrink by all means.. 
I'm ambivalent about Weiner getting in the race. It is critical that we elect a progressive rather than Christine Quinn. If Weiner's entry solidifies the opposition, fine. If it splinters it and reduces the chances for other contenders - De Blasio for the most part - then he should stay away. <br/><br/>The question really is - when the ads of him posing in his underwear hit, will they have a devastating impact? Pix are very difficult to rebut. Remember, there were no pix of Clinton in his underwear or Spitzer in his black socks. Pix are trouble. So those who are waiting for a white Jewish knight to ride up in a white Volvo - think long and hard. 
'One fateful tweet?' I don't think so. If Weiner can't call it what it was, a serious addiction, then I have little hope that he's prepared to be honest in office, either. 
Ms Abedin seems authentically interested in public service and I hope she is allowed to use her talents. Mr. Weiner seems authentically and dangerously enamored with himself. His interest in public service seems to be about his ego. He is off the public stage and should stay away.
?We have been in a defensive crouch for so long,? Weiner said. ?We are ready to clear the decks on this thing"...."one of their regular joints"..."have a handle on is their public life".........<br/><br/>Can you think of puns for the quotes above?  <br/><br/>Maybe it's too soon.  I like his politics and intelligence, but just imagine the late night puns about almost everything he says.  Even if he remarried and hyphenated his last name.......no, it's too soon.
"Their lives have become too small, too circumscribed, too claustrophobic for a couple accustomed to public life".  Translation:  narcissists demand constant attention.  One doesn't post tasteless photos of oneself on Twitter without a pathological need to be perceived in a big way.<br/><br/>Obviously, still no lesson learned and nothing new to see here.  Next!
A. Weiner has already demonstrated he is not a capable representative of the people . His hubris, self-centered, obnoxious, rantings, commonly exhibited in the congress were not productive in the political dialog. He was largely an embarrassment to his colleagues. His lack of awareness all along culminating in this, really you can't make this stuff up, his run for mayor! One marvels at the stories created by the media. 
I'm sure if you try hard enough or pay enough money you can find a poll that will tell you exactly what you want it to tell you.<br/><br/>IMO, Anthony Weiner should not re-enter the political arena. Yes, some voters are gullible, but most have no patience for loud-mouth, polarizing, politicos with sexual peccadilloes. Plus, you have all those Twitter photos that will never go away and Weiner's accusations and denials. Does the voting public really deserve a return to all this baggage? 
Before the tweet, he was quoted as saying that if he became Mayor he would rip up all the bike lanes.  So, I'm voting against him even as I root for much happiness for the extraordinary woman he was so incredibly fortunate to marry.  
I hated Weiner the politician but admire the man for facing his problems and re-prioritizing his life.  Humility and transparency are rare commodities for public figures.
He is a New Yorker, and an American.<br/><br/>As such, he deserves a Take Two, a second chance. Yes, he misled some, but mostly his Family. But there was no blood on the floor with whatever he did . No one got hurt. It was all very silly, almost juvenile, and quite immature. But that is what it was, and no more.<br/><br/>Let him relent, pay his dues, but please give him a second chance. Having seen the other side, perhaps he will be a better public servant now, cognizant of the weaknesses that we all have, and we all grapple with every day of our lives.<br/><br/>Cheers! And God Bless.
Good news, can Client #9 be next?
Of course he will run. And he should. Everyone makes mistakes. And America loves the story of redemption. 
A few weeks after savaging Christine Quinn, the Times rehabilitates Anthony Weiner?
Of course he will run. And he should. We all make mistakes. And America loves the story of redemption. 
I liked him and thought he was run out of politics unfairly. What he did had, at worse, only marginal relationship to his job, and other politicians (Democrats and Republicans) wanted his head. The choice should have been left up to the electors of Brooklyn and Queens. He would have had to run again anyway, perhaps in a reconfiqured district, and running people out of office actually harms the democratic process. And I have met him at campaign events. He was remarkably charismatic and actually funny. That being said, I suspect his time has passed for running for mayor, at least this time around. I suspect he has long wanted to be major of New York City but the field is already defined for the Democratic primaries and de Blasio probably has likely Weiner votes sewed up. I hope he reconsiders. He doesn't need to lose a primary and  I hope he decides instead to run in a Congressional primary next time around. 
I am a tree hugging liberal, but when it comes to the "Public Trust" - There are no second chances!     
Nah, don't think so. Stopped reading on third page.   We've got enough over inflated egos in politics, nothing special here.  Surprised the Times could get sucked into this.
Going for the mayor's job will end his political ambitions with a loss.<br/>He should stick to being a private citizen and use his very obvious talents to better his relationship with his wife and son.<br/>Make some money for them doing something productive, but out of public servise.<br/>Just my 2 cents.
Huma should have trusted her first impressions and initial resistance, but then again, she wanted what Weiner had to offer. If New Yorkers are willing to believe that the man has changed his stripes, then they deserve him as mayor. Maybe he and ex-governor Spitzer can both bring about a major return of sleaze together...
Wow, what a softball piece. The Times, yet again, carrying water for a liberal politician. No accountability for the weeks of pathological lying to the public? <br/><br/>Stay home with your family Mr Weiner, and continue to repair those relationships. Maybe get a real job in the private sector. You are not as needed in public service as your massive ego seems to think. 
Weiner tripped up in a uniquely modern form. Judging from my Gen X peers, his behavior is a not uncommon way that married men act out when there are issues (even as simple as a wife who has to travel a lot).  <br/><br/>Honestly?  To me what he did is minor.  The only reason it is a public issue is because of the unfortunate, distasteful pictures.   Yes, he owes his wife a big apology and a commitment to do psychotherapy. But absent other issues, his virtual dalliances should neither end a marriage nor a political career. <br/><br/>We have far too few liberal firebrands.  I'd be happy to see Weiner back.  
We are all so obsessed with men behaving badly that we sometimes miss that men, and women, are human beings.  Imperfect yes, and capable of great love at our best.  It is heartwarming to read about a couple so devoted to each other despite such public difficulty.
With apologies to Arthur Miller, life isn't only a "casting off," but a building up. I began reading this piece ready to scorn Anthony Weiner (and admittedly, his wife). But he (and they) are doing the hard work, and wherever that work takes him professionally doesn't really matter. The cynics will spin their own view of purpose here, but I'd rather think that this honest assessment is a way to both cast off and build. 
Way to early to get that scandal off the books! Makes me sure of my feelings about Politicians... they are arrogant and don't see their beyond their own self-love.<br/>I wouldn't vote for him and think he will spoil the ticket assuming the Democrats allow him near it.<br/>Sorry, don't want to even read his name. Ugh.<br/>KM Woodstock, NY
What ever happened to the old 'you were tested and you failed' culture.<br/>Seriously who is going to back this buffoon?<br/>Every time I see his face I guffaw - it is like seeing Mr. Spitzer on Bloomberg.<br/>I think we need to cancel the multiple political do-over idea.
"I wasn?t really thinking."<br/><br/>Ten pages of airing dirty laundry in the NYT, ponderous thoughts about thoughtlessness - does not get my vote.<br/><br/>Please don't run for mayor - or any other office.  Such a waste of money.
Manhattan apartment? How does unemployed Anthony and his civil servant wife (isn't her job in DC, by the way--- the darling of Hillary's staff?) afford a Manhattan apartment? Who is paying them thousands per month, and for what? 
After the Lewinsky scandal, we needed to forgive Bill Clinton because he was the president and it was better for the country to forgive and move on to avoid more turmoil and angst.<br/><br/>For the same reason, Abedin had to forgive Weiner. They were married; she was pregnant. As long as he seemed genuinely contrite and she could keep him on a short leash, it made more sense to salvage the relationship.<br/><br/>But does Ameriican need to forgive Weiner? Good God, no. He's irrelevant. We have no stake in him whatsoever. Why risk giving a man more power when he has already shown us he cannot handle the privileges of political office?
We've seen enough of him already - literally and figuratively.  Just.go.away.
It's hard for me to understand how politicians expect us to forget their indiscretions - whether personal, like Weiner, or financial, like Corzine. For Weiner to be contemplating a run for the Mayor says to me that he assumes his past mistakes are all water under the bridge, and yes, it is good to forgive, but at what point do politicians mistakes not stay with them as part of how they would govern. If they make poor choices in their personal life, doesn't it carry over to how they lead? He wouldn't get my vote. 
I have never really gotten this whole "he's making sacrifices by going into public service" bit.  He wants power, plain and simple.  Also, let's also not forget that his invective in general was so bad for the public conversation.  Even if I agreed with 90% of what he said, he had such a brusque demeanor and it really degraded the standards for how people treat one another.  Which leads to the ultimate question:  what's she doing with him??
Everyone knows his punishment was worse than his "crime." Whether people will vote for him again is another matter. 
Of all the thousands of people who could do the job of Mayor, why him?  His ambition?  He's back?  
Poor Weiner, he just wanted people to love every part of him.  Nice psychobabble but why does a man who repeatedly lied to his constituents and the press deserve public office - the fact that he didn't even notice how bad he was at lying speaks volumes to the man's narcissism. 
I wish this guy would just go away....no more press on him either.  Thank you.
The troubling point that I take away from this piece is the following. Weiner identified  ?one fateful Tweet" as the source of his problems. That might indicate that he is focused on how he got caught and not on what he did. As we know, there were many tweets, emails and Facebook and other communications with at least six women. He only got CAUGHT on one. I'm no psychologist, but it seems to me that he needs to recognize that it is all of those communications and the sum total of his behavior and not ?one fateful Tweet" that are critical- to his recovery and to his marriage much more than to any political viability. 
He would be a good mayor for the city. Most importantly, I hope he just becomes a great husband to his wife, and a great dad for his son.
I came up with a more accurate headline for this article: "A well connected couple calls in a favor from a friend/buddy at the NYT"
Weiner is a smart and capable guy who has a lot to offer in so many fields -- other than elected political office.  I might vote for Huma.
Reading Margaret Thatcher's obituary, one thing that stood out was how she treated her staff, especially its junior members. She might excoriate civil service bureaucrats, call cabinet ministers "vegetables" and "wets" to their faces but towards those who toiled for her behind the scenes she behaved with great circumspection and self-restraint, and often kindness. This, although she was Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister of England. Was it because she never ceased to be a grocer's daughter who grew up above his store?<br/><br/>I mention this seemingly unrelated story in her obituary because I remember reading about how Rep. Weiner treated his staff in a Wall Street Journal article: abominably.  Berated them in public. Threw things at them, even telephones. Tantrums. Firings. Why? Because they'd displeased him in some way. Or they hadn't measured up to his "standards". Of course, since then we've discovered what Rep. Weiner's standards really were; and then some. I haven't forgotten the public relations disaster after his sexting messages surfaced. His empty protestations of innocence. Absurd conspiracy theories. All lies.<br/><br/>Lies. Damned lies. Blatant, unrepentant lies.<br/><br/>I also remember how he humiliated his lovely wife.<br/><br/>Why pursue public office? What's the point? Bloomberg, I think I understand. Restless, relentless and vastly wealthy already (why money never factored into it), he needed an outlet, something big to do. And he sought validation.<br/><br/>What motivates Weiner?
Having the good fortune to have moved out of New York many years ago, I would not be able to vote for "shoeless and shameless" Anthony, even though I lived around the corner from his current haunt in Gramercy Park.<br/><br/>The fact that he, like a bunch of other low-lifes who are addicted to power,  is the subject of ten pages in this Sunday's Magazine makes me think twice about walking down the road to my mailbox to pick up the paper. 
I think you should run.
If Bill Clinton can do it, so can Weiner! 
People can learn from their mistakes. <br/><br/>Wallace lived to disavow racism.<br/><br/>Weiner made a mistake. His mistake caused nobody to lose their home, their jobs or their savings. His mistake did not spoil the air or water or lead us to pre-emptive war. No one was touched, and aside from disappointed constituents, the only real hurt was to himself and his wife. And they worked it out - real family values.<br/><br/>I don't know him personally, but I always looked forward to hearing him go off on the House floor. <br/><br/>In a time of wimpy Democrats, his full throated voicing of my concerns was a major relief. At a time when Republican ideologues freely give wholesale condemnation to wide swaths of the population, including several demographics that include me, it was refreshing to hear his New York voice &amp; be included in the beautiful mosaic of America. <br/><br/>Ten years after the 9/11 catastrophe, when Congress still couldn't find funds to help our still suffering first responders?.... bless Anthony Weiner for saying out loud that that was a real  moral disgrace.<br/><br/>He could get my vote, depending.<br/>In a field where Quinn leads? He would get my vote definitely.
This interview feels unscripted and authentic and I respect both of their resiliency. At some point you have to crawl out of the hiding place. As far as returning to public life, it strikes the right note. The political advisor may be right that there are other qualified candidates, but regardless of the outcome, there does not appear to be a huge downside to running. 
A comeback for Mr. Weiner? No Thank You. He violated a trust, lied about it, and displayed gross stupidity. This is exactly  the unkind of behavior America does not need, cannot afford, and should not accept from its leaders. 
Weiner should not run for Mayor. While your article focussed on his personal issues, he was an advocate and a firebrand for the liberal cause. There was no indication that he was a capable manager. He appears completely unqualified for the Mayoralty. He should get back into public life as an advocate, a writer, a pundit, a personality. If he wins acceptance for his ability to be impactful, then he can go back into a political life and run for office.
The man is delusional. What makes him think that there's any public desire for anything that he's peddling? <br/><br/>These disgraced politicians, this guy, the fellow who hiked the Appalachians,  make me laugh, how they cannot fathom ever getting a real job like in a hardware store or delivering pizzas, you know, something that they have genuine aptitude for.
I don't understand this article, ten pages about a scandal that amounted to an adolescent prank that was blown way out of proportion.  The article is absurd.  Can you imagine ten pages devoted to the marital problems among the Bushes or Obamas because one of them authorized a drone attack that killed innocent people?  And, how that affected their feelings and relationship? No.  Such articles are not written.  This article reflects that absurdity.
Scandal and notoriety and such utter self indulgent foolishness, as Wiener's, should be sufficient to ban him  from politics.  There are many more  talented people with better judgement in New York.  Just being known should not be enough for public office.
There is a tremendous narcissism evidenced both in Weiner's past actions and in his contemplated run for mayor.  The claim that he lied extensively to the public to protect his wife is facile and not credible.  He should show the good judgment to stay out of the public eye and the public arena for decades, not for a mere couple of years.
The same personality traits that make this guy send lewd photos and then not resign immediately are in play with him exploring running for office again.<br/>Enough already.  Just go away!
Good, bad or indifferent it is truly amazing how the American people rehabilitate disgraced politicians. Think of Clinton, Spitzer, Stanford and now Weiner. About the only one who went down for the count and basically stayed there was Nixon. 
Enough already.<br/>Weiner made a Social Media mistake, a thirteen year old , wouldn't  make.<br/>It is so not in the same ball park, as the last few, Republican sex scandals.<br/>He had the opportunity to tell the truth, and didn't. That was the mistake.<br/>The Republican sex scandals, were  ferreted out by the media. Undeniable<br/>on their base. Now all, but a few perverts, have  been forgiven, and ready<br/>for reelection .<br/>Time for the Democrats, to show a little forgiveness, and back  Weiner, in<br/>his future political life.  
Oh Goody: he learned from his mistake. Will he have to murder someone to learn that murder is wrong. Someone who posts a bulging-crotch photograph on the internet is deeply flawed in a manner which is irredeemable. Surly, in this this great nation of ours, there must any number of individuals of numerous genders, ethnicities, capacities and backgrounds who are capable of running the City without first publishing documentary evidence of their engorged naughty bits to discover that this is wrong.
Weiner's disgusting behavior may not be a hindrance to a  return to politics. The integrity bar has not been  lowered, it is on the floor. When a President can have an affair in the Oval Office with a college intern,  when a congressman's boyfriend can operate a male prostitution ring out of their apartment, and when a senator can leave a girl in a car to drown while he swims to safety, all without killing their political careers, Weiner can certainly jump back in to the swamp.
You would never have participated in the rehabilitation of a conservative couple.  Never.  
Would love to see him back. He was good for the country.
Love her, hate him!  Time to put that little nudnick's public career behind us - even before his wiener stole the show he was obnoxious
Weiner says that his brother advised ?don?t do it if it?s going to screw you up again.? ? As if Weiner didn?t do anything, it just happened to him. His moment of infamy exposed - the ---- pea brain and a deep seated need for power and attention.  Poor man, he hasn't been to a red carpet event in two years! <br/><br/>That said, in politics he had plenty of company - it's the norm to be full of yourself. Our system almost requires it, just to be able to raise the amount of funds necessary to make a run. Clinton was and yet was a fine President despite unremitting attacks on him. Spitzer is so bright I wish he were investigating investment banks and the like for the feds. With Weiner ? it?s up to his district and NYC. But ? emotionally ? hey, he is a jerk. And would have been fired form most jobs for his bone-headed activity.
Sounds like Anthony Weiner has powerful friends at the New York Magazine. I found the story interesting (and inspiring) but this seems part of a media campaign to rehabilitate Weiner. Nevertheless it's quite nice that perhaps we'll see the emergence of more normal politicians -- weak like us, not picture-perfect like they pretend to be.
We lost a good Liberal Congressman because of a human flaw, which, though embarrassing, was not illegal, but when a Republican, like Senator Vitter sleeps with a prostitute, he asks God's forgiveness and carries on with the Republican onslaught to good government! Explain that if you can!
You have got to be utterly mad, drunk or seriously kidding.<br/><br/>Anthony Weiner has the emotional maturity of a teenager and I would worry if he was put in charge of my local 7-11 (and that's unfair to 7-11 and people running them)...<br/><br/>This idea you can maneuver around reality and ignore reality for your own purposes is a deeply troubling malady that seems to pervade the ranks of economic and political elites.<br/><br/>These people like Weiner just don't know how much they truly don't know or get. 
Hmmm. I could use a life of official disgrace. Weiner (ha ha ha) doesn't sound to be suffering near the conundrums of dispair that the unemployed experience. E.g., everyone knows a woman's dry cleaning costs more than a man's. She's butting or footing the bills, of course. Wonderful. Jordan can be in the care of an idle presence in his father. What am I saying? He's tacky and so why would his story or situation (if there is one) make the NY Times? Who cares, in other words. Who cares? Did you pay the guy? What?! And no baby pics? Hello!
Don't we have enough entitled narcissists in politics? Do we really need Anthony Weiner in office again? 
Huma Abedin is great.<br/><br/>My feeling about Anthony Weiner is at the very least the guy has terrible judgment.  What do we need that for?
Oh please.  This guy needs to find a new career, one unrelated to politics.  
Run. Their proximity to the Clintons should tell them all they need to know.   His transgressions pale in comparison to Bill Clinton's, and look at the comeback he has staged.  Bill Clinton was a key player in keeping President Obama in office last year, and people now know we still highly value his gifted voice on issues.  I'd rather see a superb fighter like Mr. Wiener in a national office position, but if he chooses to run for mayor - great!  In the far right, we most certainly have the barbarians at the gate, and the vast talent of Mr. Wiener will be much more valuable to people if he is in office rather than at home changing diapers.
Weiner was a great politician who represented his district well.  When I think of the scandals that Republicans, bankers, etc have both engaged in and ignored to continue on their immoral journey of bilking the public I think that Weiner's issues were between his wife and him.  Don't the Republicans love to find a scandal in a popular, successful Democrate, even to the point of creating one....Hillary Clinton's age for instance by those men older than her.  I'd vote for him if I still lived in New York. 
This guy has no shame. Just go away.
Marv Albert. Eliot Spitzer, Anthony Wiener...who cares, keep moving, shove forward, voter are morons, grab everything, principles don't matter --chutzpah means shamelessness!
NYT is helping this guy back into politics; you should not take sides
Weiner slipped and fell. But America is about redemption if nothing else? So let him up. Let him run! [As to why he slipped and fell? Mild case of testosterone poisoning. Every man of us suffers from it to some degree. Can be fatal (to the sufferer or those around him); seldom is.] This man seems recovered. Let him up! And let him run.
