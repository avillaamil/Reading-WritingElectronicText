You have to have lived in the UK in 1978 to understand Margaret Thatchers achievements. The main one was turning the UK from the 'sick man of europe' to a much more thrusting economy.<br/>Many of us were considering emigrating, my family were off to  Canada, mainly because of the way Labour had, once again, mismanaged the UK economy.<br/>She was an excellent Project Manager and steered the UK away from the brink to a much more self dependent and sound future. She was single minded and understood the essence of our country and the threat to our way of life and culture from the left.<br/><br/>Some would say we need someone like her again, to stop the centre left ruining our culture, economy &amp; country.<br/><br/>She is by a long way the best post war Prime Minister .. 
She overcame many obstacles in her own life life to get where she did, but she never saw the need for removing obstacles so they didn't exist for others.
Let her funeral be funded and conducted by the private sector, not by the public taxpayers.
She didn't mince words.  She made up her mind and acted, instead of seeing which way the wind blew.  She led in the man's world.  She was strong-minded, domineering, and fit the "Iron Lady'" image.<br/><br/>But it doesn't mean she was right or loved for the decisions she made during her 11 years in office.  No one we know now  came out of  the office, unscathed and unchastened. And she had  her share, much more than her fair share, for some of the right reasons.<br/><br/>For Maggie Thatcher,  it often seemed to be her way or highway.  A strong leader, with mixed legacy: she didn't leave you undecided or uncertain. She wasn't wishy-washy. Her opponents resented her with passion, her supporters didn't understand the opposition. <br/><br/>The Thatcher era passed some time ago, and now the Iron Lady.  The Brits though  divided in their opinion about her may not see another Maggie on stage again for years.<br/><br/>Maggie Thatcher, RIP.
Now that Maggie meets her beloved Ronnie in the thereafter, they can discuss the disasters they wrought. Not that they'll understand any of it, even some thirty years on.  
Margaret Thantcher was a fine woman, but I with me she will always go down as the leader who did not stand up to appartied and supported  South American right wing dictators.  
As an American who got news of Thatcher from the media here, I'm surprised and maybe better informed after reading comments here by British citizens with first hand knowledge of the Thatcher years and results.  It wasn't pretty and tilted toward the wealthy and biggest businesses.  Her bigger than life image, fed by the news media, goes on even today with the huge headlines in the Times.  She was, after all, an elderly person who died after a stroke.  Profound sadness understandably for members of her family but, for me, the headlines are fully out of proportion to the sense of loss.  
Get on board with the concepts of economic freedom and self reliance, or get left behind.  I, for one, loved the Iron Lady.
She did nothing directly for women -- had none in her cabinet, left  no legacy of female participation in UK politics. Considered Nelson Mandela a terrorist. Reversed the imperfect but constructive and vital  domestic policies built up by Labor after the devastation of World War Two with inhumane consequences for workers but windfalls for the royalists and financiers and industrialists. May the Iron Lady rust in pieces.
Ask the Irish about her 'legacy'. I'd bet you get some very different answers than all the blind worship so many seem prone to. 
Together, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan ran the Mom and Pop Store that was Conservatism in the 1980s. Among the goods they sold were union busting, brinksmanship, saber-rattling, deregulation, privatization, plutocracy, the "haves" taking from the "have-nots", a blind eye to the AIDS epidemic, and frivolous wars on little islands.<br/>They were both "great communicators", and even their critics agree that they were strong leaders. For better or worse, they both made their citizens feel patriotic and optimistic. But they both left big messes that their successors are still cleaning up today.
"She had high standards, and she expected everyone to do their work"<br/><br/>If the one thing we took from this amazing woman, was that one idea, this world would change.<br/><br/>Do your job, be responsible for yourself. Lost concepts. This is the legacy we should keep from this most amazing lady. You will be missed my lady.
Your headline: Resolute Conservative Reforged Britain.<br/>Please correct in the name of truth: headline should read:<br/>Ruthless Conservative Ravaged Britain.
I'll give Thatcher credit for not being one of today's "grey" politicians who are afraid to say or do anything remotely contentious. That's as far as it goes for me and many people from the UK.<br/><br/>Lets be clear: she went way, way too far in many areas of policy and governance (in some ways bordering on abuse of power). She brought the country to it's knees because she so divided it that even today, she remains an incredibly controversial figure.  She simply did not know the meaning of the word 'compromise' and she refused to back down on everything from the poll tax (property tax), busting the labour movement (it needed reform but not annihilation) through to selling off public assets (most sold off at bargain-basement prices) and the near-destruction of the UK's infrastructure.<br/><br/>There's very, very few people in the UK then, now or in years to come who won't be affected by her successive governments. 
Thatcher ought to be remembered for her disastrous policies, which left the UK in worse shape than it was in before she came to power. Indeed, the reverse Robin Hood polices enacted by Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan are largely still in place and increasingly battering the economies of both countries. I especially remember Thatcher for the Falkland Islands hatchet job. How embarrassing for Great Britain. 
Margaret Thatcher was the greatest democratically elected FEMALE leader in history.  And one of the most conservative.  Like President Reagan, her last years were sad.  But also like him, she lived long enough to see the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall. She  brought down the Argentine Junta (for which Argentina does not thank her),  while at home she reduced taxes (drastically) and vastly increased home ownership.  The negatives; she reduced support of the arts.  Boo hoo. 
I'm not an authority on Thatcher, but I invite anyone who is to post comments on Thatcher, the end of the Cold War and her relationship with Gorbachev.
I certainly don't think we will ever see her like again. It is sad to hear of her passing even though I did not share her political views. She certainly won't be missed by the gay community in Britain for the introduction of Section 28. The Conservative Party will never recover the trust of the gay community in Britain because of it. The deregulation of the banking sector began with her policies, and we are going to be paying the price of that for many years to come. Manufacturing and shipbuilding was abandoned to short term financial profits and preference for service industries. History may not be kind to her legacy. I also consider she could have negotiated a settlement of the Falkland Islands instead of retaking it by force even before the Conflict started with the Argentinian invasion. It was a missed opportunity. Love her or hate her, she could not be ignored.
It was obvious to anyone reading her speeches that Margaret Thatcher knew the works of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics. She was singular in her understanding of the link between freedom and capitalism and her advocacy of those ideas and policies changed the world forever. A testimony to the power of an idea.
I covered her resignation for The Times in 1990.  A few months later, my wife and I attended a dinner where she and Dennis were present.  Some carping criticism she had made of  John Major, her Conservative successor, had been in the news, and after the dinner,  I went up to her and said that as a journalist, I missed her.<br/>"Well, I miss me, too!" she answered.  She was truly a one-off.
She had done a great service for her country by standing firmly with her believes.  To some extent, she was not "smart" as many modern politicians consulting daily on facebook / twitter polls and adjusting their positions. <br/><br/>I wish that I could have a chance to pay my tribute to her. 
Towering, decisive, not Towering, divisive. Divisions exist before the entry of the giant onto the stage, they exist after the giant leaves that stage. The giant is not the cause. She was a giant.
I note in this and other good obituaries of Mrs. Thatcher the small, but utterly most important bits show where her 'conservative' policies are not nearly as radical as what the leading  Americans conservatives ended up doing in their country.<br/><br/>National health? She kept it.<br/><br/>Market freedom? She kept important, quite strong regulations in place.<br/><br/>Foreign policy? She didn't put the world in to 'us v. them,' but remained flexible.<br/><br/>Over an over again, subtly in these America-centric obituaries are plenty of morsels of evidence to support the view that Thatcher saw clear limits to her conservatism that her American ideological cousins long ago irrationally charged past.
If only we had a president and members of Congress with 1/3 of her guts, vision and focus.
Americans and wealthy UK citizens revere Margaret Thatcher. For those ordinary UK citizens who lived through her terms, she was a callous leader who looked after her own party's supporters at the expense of everyday citizens. She decimated local industry in the North of England, which to this day has never recovered and remains the poorest area of England. So while you're all lauding her achievements, let's not forget you are looking at her through rose-tinted glasses and spare a thought for the people who live their lives in poverty because of her policies. For every citizen who is "pouring out their grief", there are ten who will quietly be remembering the horror she put most of the country through.
Perhaps it is not seemly at the time of Thatcher's demise to note the lasting and devastating consequences of Thatcherism policies but at a time in the United States when politicians here today,  of similar mind about cuts and Ayn Randian ideology, are touting similar strategies, we would do well to learn from her legacy and the consequences of austerity.<br/><br/>There are some things that can not be brought back once slashed and burned.<br/><br/>So in the end, though Margaret Thatcher was tough she was not correct.
Pretty biased obit. One should strive to present the best face of the subject in an obit, but this is out and out revanchism.  If Thatcher "reversed 35 years of Left wing government," what is one to make of the Thirteen years of Tory rule from 1951-1964; that they capitulated to the (fact of the) Welfare State and the will of the people? No doubt.<br/><br/>And what of Edward Heath for that matter, was he just a "wet", as Thatcher would have it? The truth is that Thatcher was a somewhat unwitting architect of neo-liberalism and Britain, not to the mention the rest of us, are still paying for her knuckleheadedness. If it wasn't for the Falklands War her reign would have been considerably shorter, and much happier for all concerned.
Perhaps this isn't the time or place for a "liberals vs conservatives" debate.<br/>RIP, Mrs. Thatcher.
Maybe she can have a drink with her friend ronnie raygun now.  She was a human being so RIP.
Baroness Margaret Thatcher will live in the hearts of multitudes of Croatian people and be remembered as an outstanding world leader who stood on the side of struggles against Communism, supported Croatian people?s right to self-determination, democracy and independence.<br/>Rest in peace Baroness Margaret Thatcher and Thank you! 
She improved the lot of the poor.  Critics actually recognized that, but protested the increasing inequality of wealth.  Reagan improved the lot of the poor, too.  Between 1983 and 1989 (The Reaganomic Era), poverty went down 33%.  It went down 6% from the day he was elected in 1980.<br/><br/>Famously she proved Labor wanted more inequality at the EXPENSE of the poor in a debate in Parliament.
I think that half the people who are publishing gushy tributes here just like the thrill of typing "Baroness Thatcher" or "Lady Thatcher."  The Downton Abbey Syndrome run amok.
There are few politicians of consequence who could be so sure of herself and so wrong as Margaret Thatcher.
It's quite wrong, and very tendentious, to say that Thatcher " ...pulled her country back from 35 years of left-wing government". If you bother to look, you will see that in the 34 years from 1945 to 1979, the year she became Prime Minister, there have been almost exactly equal years of Conservative and labour governments (Labour: Attlee 1945 -51, Wilson 64-70 and 74-76, Callaghan 76-79; Conservative: Churchill 51-55, Eden 55-57, Macmillan 57-63, Douglas-Home 63-64, Heath 70-74.
Thatcher ruined my country and it will probably never recover.
It is the ability to make tough, and unpopular decisions for the good of the people, that separates statesmen, from sniveling, populist politicians.  <br/><br/>The United Kingdom wouldn't be a much worse place today, had it not been for Margaret Thatcher's hard-line economic policies. And it is always a shame to hear the way most Brits are so oblivious to how much they owe her. <br/><br/>The four years I spent in Scotland illuminated how strong the sense of entitlement in the UK really is. The nanny-state model which they have been increasingly adopting, is essentially a glorified form of the Serfdom that predominated Europe in the Middle Ages. <br/><br/>Thank you Margaret Thatcher!!!
I am greatly saddened by the death of Lady Thatcher. She has been a inspiration to me and to many strong and independent women around the world... As a Chinese student I lived in London during the Thatcher years in the 1980s. I was deeply moved by one of her speeches: "Its doesn't matter where you are, where you come from. If you can make a contribution to our society and if you can build up a future for yourself, if you can, jolly good luck to you."??<br/><br/>My favorite line was when she said: "If a woman like Eva Peron, with no ideals, can get that far, think how far I can go with all the ideals that I have."??<br/><br/>Margaret Thatcher was the greatest leading lady of all time!  <br/><br/>Farewell the "Iron Lady", your legacy will continue to inspir women for generations to come...
Lady Thatcher was the person who turned Britain from a European-third-world country, forever paralysed by strikes, impoverished and having lost all sense of dignity into a proud, rich, world-beacon country. I was proud to live in England in the early 1980s, when the effects of her policies were starting to be noticeable, and when my own country, under the "guidance" of president Mitterrand, was sinking into the second-rate local power it has been ever since. My heartfelt condolences to her children : millions of us feel orphaned today !
Before the western world got its Iron Lady in Margaret Thatcher (may her soul RIP), there was the original Iron Lady of the Middle East ? Golda Meir (PM of Israel, 1969-74) and the Durga Devi of the subcontinent ? Indira Gandhi (PM of India, 1966-77, 1980-84). They all got things done!<br/><br/>It?s been a couple of decades, since the world has had a dominant female head of state, so it might be our time.  Are you listening, Hillary Clinton?  After all it was Ms. Thatcher who said, ?If you want something said, ask a man...if you want something done, ask a woman.?  The U.S. is craving for something to get done!
R.I.P. .
She called Nelson Mandela and the Zimbabwe's Patriotic Front terrorists whilst at the same time condoning Apartheid South Africa. As a black Southern African I have no fond memories of her. The stereotypical racist western leader
It is said both Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan suffered from Dupuytren's Contracture, a fairly rare, sometimes genetic condition of the hand where a change in the nature of collagen in the palm causes a thickening that creates cords, making the fingers bend inward toward the palm.  Isn't that a remarkable coincidence among these political allies?  Both also degenerated into dementia.<br/><br/>12:25 p.m.
As a native Californian (DOB: 1935), I linked The Iron Lady with Reagan, an anti-intellectual, second-rate movie actor, as well as being a slick demagogue.<br/><br/>He did his utmost to castrate our state's universities. <br/><br/>In stark contrast to R., T. earned a Degree from Oxford in chemistry; she was a single female employed as a chemical researcher before marrying a factory owner.  <br/><br/>Various items during her days in power:<br/><br/>Somehow, she succeeded in justifying Briton's victory in the Falklands War.  <br/><br/>Perhaps the main question about her legacy is:  "Did she do more harm than good?"<br/><br/>Admirably, she reversed herself by placing sanctions against Apartheid in S.Africa.  Hence, she could be convinced to change when she was in error.<br/><br/>History alone may accurately judge her idolatry of a free market, as well as her faulty appraisal of the common Briton of her day.  If half of my earnings were taxed, as was the case of my Brit counterpart, I would definitely demand that the government be a humane one, not simply a tool of the upper classes.
?Thatcher the Milk Snatcher? ran a new headline when ?That Woman? (my Mother?s words) decided to stop the daily delivery of the one third pint milk bottles free to every school in England. Her ghastly braying voice and bullying tactics were everything my family hated. If Ian Richardson had worn a skirt in ?House of Cards? it would have been accurate. No, she did not commit murder, but she did condemn many communities to die and deepened a gulf between the North and South of my old country. And like all demagogues her own party finally tired of the continual strain of defending her. <br/><br/>I can remember almost driving off the road in Boston in 1990 when I heard on a taped course how the speaker admired ?little Maggie Thatcher? because she had worked her way up to the top from so humble beginnings. My stomach turned. It represented the weird reverence Americans seemed to have, I could only assume out of ignorance, for this woman who did not grow up in poverty or anything like it but had a relatively comfortable middle class childhood. <br/><br/> My favorite quote about her comes from the movie, ?Brassed Off? when the leader of a competition winning brass band from a dying northern town refuses to accept the prize cup and instead delivers a scathing attack on the politics of the day as it affected his working brothers and their families. At one point he pauses for breath and says, ??and Margaret Thatcher still lives!?
Her ideology and legacy should be buried with her.
Americans loved Margaret Thatcher, just like they love Downton Abby and One Direction.  The people who endured her feel differently.  I'm sure her family is sad she's gone, especially since her children who made careers out of being her kiddies.   Elvis Costello expressed my feelings on the Iron Lady's death years ago.
Comments and journalists from the left keep referring to the 'gap between rich and poor' under thatcher but ignore the fact that there was record-breaking immigration. So what do you expect when you let in millions of poor immigrants? Same in our country.
I remember Thatcher as the cause of increased wage disparity, a champion for unregulated economic activity that had a negative economic impact on the prople and that is still very much felt today.  Thatcher and Regan and their trickle down economic theory contributed to a culture of greed and promoted individuals over community.  She was also another zealot for war; not a trait to be admired.  
Well, in all fairness then, since Mrs. Thatcher "remade" Britain, she is responsible for what Britain is today.  Right?  Right.  
Under the Thatcher regime, if you had nowt - you were nowt.
Under the Thatcher regime, if you had nowt - you were nowt.
De mortius nil nisi bonum, but this euology (rather than obituary) gratuitously injects highly partisan (and highly dubious) political opinion. Its reading of the economic and social climate through and before Thatcher's tenure is essentially nonsensical propaganda.
Margaret Thatcher was a dreadful person.<br/>I am English, 67 years old and saw at first hand the effects of the Thatcher years. She was the only Prime Minister in recent history who chose not only to defeat a Trade Union (National Union of Mineworkers) but to destroy the industry that employed its memebers. She set UK Police Officers against striking mineworkers and did not have the wit to out-manoeuvre a minor ideologue of Arthur Skargills calibre.<br/>Margaret Thatcher squandered the fruits of North Sea oil and Gas and presided over the decimation of the remnants of UK manufacturing, thereby critically unbalancing our economy. We still live with the effects of her woeful economic ignorance.<br/> I was raised to look after my neighbour; Thatcher derided this outlook as simplistic nostalgia. She thought deregulating the Stock Market a good idea and we got the likes of James Archer who, in common with his father, would not reognise truth if he walked into it.<br/>I am no Tory and have little time for them, but I was ashamed to see Thatcher treat a completely decent man like Geoffrey Howe with such utter public contempt. Have a look at his resignation speech if you can spare the time; it is a classic of its type and an example of Parliamentarians at their best. If you do have a look, glance over Howe's left shoulder at a sniggering Jonathan Aitkin who thought Margaret so unworldly she believed Sinai was the plural of sinus. Now, what happened to Jonathan I wonder?
I respect this woman, I'm sad for her !!
As someone who was selling British products abroad, Britain was a laughing stock in the late 70's with everything we made compared to British Leyland, the very worst cars made by the most powerful unions, managed by cowering incompetents. The respect she gained for Britain and the defeat of the unions transformed the world's view of this country. People were hurt, as they unfairly are in any war, and Thatcher vs the unions was certainly a war, and the good guys won, thank goodness. 
The changes that we all, lazily, label and ascribe to Reagan and Thatcher's counter-revolution merely refers to the two rather lackluster individuals chosen to spearhead a move to save a gravely faltering capitalism by tapping into the populace's darkest impulses and allowing a Potemkin village of a healthy economic system to be put in place.  We are now living through round two or three of the same phenomenon.
I know it is more or less the accepted thing to write something nice about someone on their passing. I could not muster the self deception to do so in this case.<br/><br/>One thing I will always remember about her is that she worked very hard, along with other "conservatives", to lessen the sanctions on South Africa while Nelson Mandela was still in prison. Then, she argued that those sanctions should be lifted entirely. They are such "small bore" sanctions, she told the media. This is a bit like conservatives trying to reform Medicare in our country: they never wanted it in the first place, so how is it they should be put in charge of making it better?<br/><br/>I have never understood, also, this grand admiration for the "Iron Lady" mystique. Inflexibility and insistence that things must be only your way? This is a wonderful trait? Obama gets criticized, minute by minute, when he insists that anything he wants should be followed. I suppose Thatcher's great personal accomplishment was to make intransigence into an asset. <br/><br/>Her opposition to unions in England, bloated, lazy and often corrupt, was not without merit. Just as management can easily turn toward corruption if left unchecked, unions with near absolute power never stop trying to get more for their members. Every force requires a counterbalancing force. This does not make her heroic. <br/><br/>The best I can say about her is that she made a very strong impression on her times and she got her way in most things. <br/><br/><a href="http://terryreport.com" title="http://terryreport.com" target="_blank">http://terryreport.com</a>
You gotta love the Times! Mrs. Thatcher gets labeled as "hardheaded" because she had firm core conservative beliefs. A politician with firm core liberal beliefs is labeled as "principled", never hardheaded. Let's look at those conservative beliefs "the belief that economic freedom and individual liberty are interdependent, that personal responsibility and hard work are the only ways to national prosperity, and that the free-market democracies must stand firm against aggression".  We clearly don't have enough of that "hardheadedness" in today's leaders. If only we did!
If the British economy was in the dumps in 1979, it certainly wasn't because income tax rates were too low and the rich weren't paying their "fair share."<br/><br/>They top rate of income tax was an eye watering 83% and even the bottom rate was 33%. There were no Romneys paying 12% tax.<br/><br/>Thatcher, correctly in my view, understood that these income tax rates were too high and that they were damaging the economy.<br/><br/>It gives some important perspective - unbelieveable to think that to get the Republicans to go from a top rate of 35% to 39.6% on incomes over $400,000 (8 times the national family income) was like pulling teeth.
All in all, a dreadful piece of work was accomplished, both socially and morally.
A cruel and single minded ideologue.  She forced her (largley discredited) policies through regardless of the human cost. Destroyed British manufacturing industry, created the housing crisis that haunts the UK to this day, ruined the rail network and energy supply through privatisation, oppressed the poor, marginalised the gay community. A hate figure to many people throughout the land.
I was in my teens and twenties when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, and being across the pond, only knew here reputation as the Iron Lady and a tough conservative like Ronald Reagan. From reading articles discussing her life and policies, it seems that people either revered her or hated her for her policies that fostered the demise of the labor unions as a potent force and which encouraged greater free market economy in England. For those who decried dismantling the power of the labor unions and England's current state, I wonder how England would have turned out if labor unions were allowed to keep their power and the state was still taxing at such a high rate? While I feel that there should be some government intervention in the form of services the state gives to the needy, complete socialism will never work. It is a failed theory that has been tested many times in the last century. Your country may run on socialism, but the rest of the world works on capitalism and free market economy and the only way to compete is to be able to meet other nations and trading partners on their terms. I sense that Mrs. Thatcher's policies were just right in the beginning, and were what Britain needed to stand up again, but that by the end of three terms, it seemed that her views had become obsolete and were more of a hinderance than a help. Maybe in 100 years we'll be able to see just how effective she really was. In any case, she was a great lady and may she rest in peace.
Early in Mrs. Thatcher's tenure, I began hiring English girls to help me with my children in another nearby country, on au pair terms. I had hundreds of applications every year from young women desperate to find work and it was a piece of cake to find my pearl. By the mid-nineties, after the Thatcher reforms, impossible! New prosperity in the UK had brought jobs for young people and only the least-qualified still struggled. A miracle! God bless her.
My family and I lived in England from 1982 to '87, during the height of Margaret Thatcher's powers. At the time, I didn't realize what an extraordinary person she was or what extraordinary times those were. We lived in the north, where unemployment was most severe and the coal-mining industry felt the full force of Thatcherism. Seeing the effects of those policies up close, I was no fan of hers. But Britain was in a mess in so many ways, and the nation needed someone as tough and single-minded as she was to turn things around, and she was right about many things. But she seems like some Greek tragic figure: the same traits that made her so strong metastasized into something like hubris. She did not know when, or maybe how, to stop, which finally was her political undoing. Still, Margaret Thatcher was a remarkable person. No doubt she transformed Britain--in some ways for the worse, but on balance more for the better, I now think. 
By even the most critical of standards, Baroness Margaret Thatcher was a great leader and skilled politician.  Her conservative policies brought  stringent, toughness and nationalization that  left its mark and not always favorable. <br/><br/>However, in the big picture, Thatcher was a strong and competent leader who has left a no less than monumental legacy in the history of British politics. <br/><br/>Our most  sincere condolences to her family, colleagues and admirers here and in Britain.
Lady Thatcher stood for her beliefs, did her best. <br/><br/>She was the best diagnostician, a good physician, but she was unable to alter the ethic in her own hospital. <br/><br/>She dared to lead, her people lacked the needed courage to follow.<br/><br/>England today bears witness. What would this once great nation be now if subsequent leaders had the courage of The Iron Lady? <br/><br/>We may never know.
Destructive, uncreative, the master of 'Cuts'.<br/><br/>She led a party whose catch phrase was 'To Cut'. Rather than act and think creatively hers was to rely upon short sightedness and tight fistedness. Not surprisingly she learnt these mean values from her late father. He was a renowned as a grocer for measuring out to the exact milligram a slice of cheese,  meat, or whatever, during WW2 rationing here in the UK. Others in  the same business were more generous and humane. It ended here in the UK in 1954, but he still kept at it. Mean.<br/><br/>Having lived through her reign  as a student of art I can attest to experiencing her Government.  She hated the arts and cut funding. Maintenance of schools, hospitals, libraries, public infrastructure was 'cut'. Throughout her tenure all schools received but a lick of paint. The litany of the Thatcher Years like the last world war still resonates with visible scars. Our major orbital road around London the M25 was built under her direction, penny pinching with the cheapest concrete road surface and minimum number of lanes. Thatcher baulked at  top level advice to plan for future growth in car ownership. Result the M25 is synonymous as being the largest car park in Europe.<br/><br/>Where are we now? The Conservative administration element of the current coalition has made its business to lead in cutting rather than investing in growth, for the nation. The very Conservative MP's who voted on cutting student grants had free education.<br/><br/>I feel no sadness. 
I just returned from Ireland (Republic) where President Clinton has demigod status for helping to end the troubles. Why is it the "Left" is always left to clean up the messes of the "Right"?
Margaret Thatcher could either be revered or hated, as there was little room for mixed feeling. Likewise, one liked her unique Thatcherite version of conservatism or disliked it, there was no room for compromise. With her death, a whole new era of Twentieth century British conservatism seems to have passed, though she was lucky to see another round of conservative revival through the worthy successor, David Cameron, the present incumbent heading Conservative party led coalition government in Britain, while she breathed her last. May her soul rest in peace.
Margaret Thatcher, Winston Churchill, William Gladstone; we seem blessed to see a great leader twice in our lifetimes.<br/><br/>How long before we see the likes of such again? <br/><br/>The UK is in need of it. <br/><br/>RIP MHT.
An early comment here asked the readers of the Times who are strongly critical of Thatcher: "She was elected three times. Do you not like democracy?" My answer, the minority view I'm sure, is that failed and woeful democracies, like Britain and the U.S. presently, are no more to be liked and trusted than any failed and corrupt system. Britain is the same country that saw fit to strongly honor and praise Tony Blair at the end of his reign, after the disaster of the Iraq War, a war that couldn't have occurred without his strong support of money and troops. British leaders, despite their pleasing manner of vigorous debate in the House of Commons, feel it is civilized and dignified to honor leaders no matter how divisive and destructive they have been in office. It's as bad as the canonization of Ronald Reagan here, or the inability for Senators here to tell a few hard truths about fellow Senators who should be in jail, not in office. The voters of a failed democracy are a big part of the problem, but when the democracy is run by money and propaganda as it is here, the causes of failure are too many to count. So, no, I'm no fan, of the cruel Lady or of failed democracies.
She is worthy of great respect from all over the world. Admire for her supreme charm.
I stand by what I said. Was it sheer coincidence that prior to the Falklands War her ratings were plunging and following the war they soared? And surely "adjusting policies to goose opinion poll ratings" is what every government of every persuasion does? Of course, there is always the issue of whether they actually enact such policies.
I hope that Obama is reading these comments. The Times says she was 'revered', but I'm hearing that folks have long memories on the supporters of the 1%, wars, austerizing the poorest..... The smiles and one-liner chuckles will be forgotten in 10 years and that's when the history books get written. Obama will be remembered as Neville Chamberlain to Boener's Third Reich, and no one will forget, worldwide, the drones and Gitmo. <br/><br/>History's a funny thing. It's not true that only the victors get to write it. Thatcher was not 'revered' by the ones that matter - but she is remembered.....as a disaster.
I am greatly saddened by the death of Lady Thatcher.  She has been a inspiration to me and to many strong and independent women aoroud the world... As a Chinese student I lived in London during the Thatcher years in the 1980s.  I was deeply moved by one of her speeches: "Its doesn't matter where you are, where you come from. If you can make a cotribution to our society and if you can build up a future for yourself, if you can, jolly good luck to you."<br/><br/>My favorite line was when she said: "If a woman like Eva Peron, with no ideals, can get that far, think how far I can go with all the ideals that I have."<br/><br/>Margaret Thatcher was the greatest leading lady of all time!   Farewell
Nobody did more for so few at the expense of so many. So long "Iron Lady". 
Every single UK newspaper site has been forced to close down its comment sections on this story.<br/><br/>That tells you all you need to know.
I was at university in the US when this "stupid woman" was elevated. I thought she would be a horror for the trades unions (my father was a teamster) and for the poor. It did not take a university student to realise Reagan-Thatcher trickle-down economics was a plan to make the rich richer, and further impoverish the poor. Labour partially restored the fortunes of the trades unions, and the policies of the present coalition government are, thankfully, more reaction to the conservative stupidity of the 1980s than paeon to them. May we bury all this nonsense, both in the UK and here in the US, with the speed and cosideration so richly deserved.
An amazing woman who knew how to stand for conservative principals.  She will be well missed.
Conservative radio swamis are already using Margaret Thatcher's death as another excuse to bash Barack Obama.  They're sneering 'Why can't Obama be more like Margaret Thatcher?"  Or "Barack Obama is no Maggie Thatcher."<br/><br/>What a disgrace.
Thatcher used a propaganda machine to convince the world that she was not evil.  She called Mandela a terrorist, authorized the killing of Irish Nationalists and peace campaigners, sanctioned the lies of the death of 96 Liverpool football supporters and took bribes from Murdoch.<br/>A truly horrible woman, more divisive than any other UK politician.  Move military personnel into the police force to suppress civil unrest, set up police groups to infiltrate and subvert peaceful protest, bribed Mid East politicians to take UK armaments, sold weapons to Iraq and Iran illegally.  Sold off housing, health service, power industry, transport, water, natural gas, all of which are now at the top of the UK political agenda as needing urgent repair.  Only the rich profited from her actions - millionaires became multi-milionaries, she blamed the poor for being poor and laid the foundations of it being a crime to be poor.<br/>Women were worse off after her 11 years than before, she did nothing for them.
Mrs Thatcher was a great leader of the people who own and control the British Isles.  She set about restoring advantage to what she regarded as its proper place, a task continued subsequently by the Blair and Cameron governments.  She worked extraordinarily well with the paranational agencies into whose power systems the UK fits.<br/><br/>No human being should pass unmourned and her family, friends and admirers deserve sympathy for their loss.  She was vastly important; we are living her legacy.
This is the woman who called Nelson Mandela a terrorist. Enough said.
Unlike Labor PMs who proceeded her, she did not equivocate regarding to the Eastern Bloc,  but was content to be Reagan's lapdog.
Since Margaret Thatcher stepped down in 1990, Britain hasn't seen another female prime minister. When will Britain see another "Margaret Thatcher" in Downing Street again? Probably not for a little while.<br/>During her term in office many ordinary Brits could buy their council houses and snapp up shares in the newly privatised industries such as British Gas and BT. Yet by rejecting consensus politics, she made herself a divisive figure. Her policies and governing style led to rebellion inside her party and unrest on the streets. Some Brits blamed her for the loss of Hongkong as well. In her second visit to China in September 1982, after Britain's victory over the Falklands, her self-assertiveness didn't impress Deng Xiaoping at all. 
I dunno how I feel and it really doesn't matter -- she left an indelible imprint on the world, which is more than any of us will ever do. All the odds were stacked high against her and they stayed stacked high until the end. For that reason, she was "tough" but no tougher than any good, effective leader of her time. For me though, the most influential Briton was the one who wrote that the love we take is equal to the love we make. And, in that regard, my heart breaks for the Lady. Her children magnetically unattracted to her, Dennis long gone, anyone talking about her saying the nastiest things one can say about another-- in the end, is that all there was for her? No one deserves that type of end.  Nothing that she did means anything to me if she left the world so alone. I wonder how she felt about that.
If only she had devoted her considerable intellect to science!
"But her third term was riddled with setbacks. Dissension over monetary policy, taxes and Britain?s place in the European Community caused her government to give up hard-won gains against inflation and unemployment."<br/><br/>Great to see things have changed a great deal.   <br/><br/>Fact is Thatcher and Reagan set both their nations on the road to ruinous inequality. They sometimes pushed for the policy and they sometimes ended up with a policy that went far beyond even their greatest hopes.  But their low tax loose regulation union smashing ways have given us our current paradise.  <br/><br/>May they rest in peace, as I respect civil leaders. But any nostalgia is simply for my childhood leaders and not any sorrow over their actual leadership or policies. <br/><br/>By the way there is a new Iron Lady in town. And she calls the shots from Berlin.
She did more damage to British manufacturing than the Luftwaffe. She employed the same kind of ideological inflexibility that we can see in Britain's current leadership today. And she'd feel right at home in the modern GOP. 
We can use Maggie &amp; Ron now!  
My favorite Thatcher quote, to paraphrase, ?The problem with Socialism is eventually you run out of other people?s money.?<br/><br/>A classic!
Freight-loads of people here appear to be expressing the sentiment that she was unsympathetic to the circumstances of the poor and disenfranchised. <br/><br/>My tea leaves convey that if Margaret Thatcher where not elected, and  current policies at the time were allowed to play out, the poor and disenfranchised would eventually have become utterly destitute; ...<br/>...however, there would have been more apologizing for letting that happen.
Her friendship with the Monster of Chili's dictatorship Augusto Pinochet let us know very well what neo-liberalism and thatcherism was and what is looking for just now
I didn't like Thatcher much, but there were some extreme loonies in the unions. And she did seem to have convinced Ronnie to 'do business with Gorbachev' much to the dismay of his right wing advisors. The thing I remember the most was the sight of her straining to look around a column, where the queen had put her, during the wedding of Charles and Diane. Apparently she had gone too far messing with the queen's people and the other iron lady let her know about it. Noblesse oblige. Funny. 
She did what she thought was right, even when it was wrong.
I voted for Lady Thatcher in 1979 as an 18 year old growing up in a Britain run by radical trade unions, after a winter of no heat or electricity, and twenty years of economic and political decline.<br/><br/>Her impact - love her or hate her - has been profound in Great Britain and around the world.  Her free market polices and focus on controlling our own destiny are here to stay
I didn't care for the woman.
I remember the ditty that went around England: "Maggie Thatcher, the lunch-milk snatcher" when she lobbied to have free lunch milk dropped for the poorest children.<br/><br/>That was about the same time that Ronald Reagan was lobbying to have 'ketchup' catagorized as a 'vegetable' in poor children's lunches.<br/><br/>Ah, they were quite a pair, those two........the original Austerizers.
at least the Times didn't start the article with "she made a mean beef stroganoff", but instead acknowledged the impact that a woman had on changing the world she lived in.  
May she rest in peace but Thatcher put into place economic policies that would eventually damage England as did Ronald Reagan's economic trickle down economics. They both had their wars, Thatcher the Falklands and Reagan Grenada, they were of no significance. The net financial results of these so called world leader are now revealing their damage giving world the new purveyors of greed, unfettered Banking, Wall Street manipulations and creation of financial instruments that would come to haunt us. After these two left office the warnings came, savings and loan crisis, silicon valley collapse, housing bubble collapse, Banking collapse and Wall Street greed and yet we ignored these warnings as did those before the Great Depression and we nearly tanked into a depression.
Thatcher will be remembered as Robin Hood in reverse.
The title of Baron(ess) is ironically appropriate.  It identifies her as a member of an aristocracy that has ruled England since King Alfred and William I, an aristocracy that has lived off the labors of the people while disdaining their rights and needs.
At a time when Margaret and Ronnie issued a call for "freedom," they also opened the door wide to "Greed is Good," allowing and even encouraging a rapacious capitalism without many limits. Their clarion calls which sounded so sweet at the time led us down the pretty primrose path into the recent Great Recession. 
At this historic moment, it is fitting to honor a strong, principled leader with an iron will, one who increased the measure of human dignity and freedom in the world, one who made an indelible mark on the 20th century.<br/><br/>I refer, of course, to Nelson Mandela.
End of an Era. I will always remember as the one who gave everything to make the crazy world a safe place for our children and grandchildren to inhabit. RIP Lady Thatcher. 
My mother hated her with a vengeance - mainly because of the Poll Tax - and was delighted when she resigned as Prime Minister. She called me to tell me so. I was living in Canada and so I was a long-distance spectator during her 'reign'. She got the Falklands right (and got re-elected as a result). She got most of the rest - the industrial base, Europe - wrong. She was way too divisive.
God bless her soul. She needs it.
R.I.P.<br/>you are always an IRON hero in my mind, my regard idol..<br/>" There is something else which one feels, That is a sense of this country's destiny: the  countries of history and experience which ensure that, when principle s have to defended, when good has to be upheld and when evil has to be overcome, Britain will take up arms..... "
I lived in Britain through the Thatcher year's and have nothing but loathing for her and her policies. At least half of Britain will be celebrating today without sorrow. She destroyed much about Britain that was good while she cosied up to Dear Ronnie and vested interests. I could go on but I'll leave it here. 
From today's nyt's "Beneath the Kilt:"  His new documentary, ?The Spirit of ?45,? which opened in Britain in March, can be connected thematically to ?The Angels? Share.? It celebrates the 1945-51 Labour government?s creation of the welfare state and its nationalization policy, which created thousands of jobs. It also traces how Margaret Thatcher?s Conservative government dismantled public ownership through privatization, leading to the highest unemployment since the 1930s. 
De mortuis nihil nisi bonum is something I believe in, but not on this occasion. I am of the opinion that her actions led to more harm than good, and that, along with Ronald Reagan, she started an era of materialism that will stunt the growth of the human spirit around the world. 
Wow, 8 online pages. No way I can read all that. I do not even remember whether I originally liked her or not.<br/><br/>What I remember were huge signs in Buenos Aires about Islas Malvinas, also known as Falklands. <br/><br/>Her victory there got rid indirectly of the murderous Argentinean generals without the need to invade Argentina proper. From my point of view, that was her greatest accomplishment although a side effect of her popular retaking of Falklands, still 'disputed islands' in freezing South Atlantic.<br/><br/>It was truly heroic on her part: she almost lost her best friend and soul mate Reagan who did not care about Argentinean generals but had to acknowledge the existence of  South America.
I am British and I am of the utmost belief that Thatcher's legacy is on of decimation of wholse swathe communities, manufacturing base, misappropriation of the North Sea Oil Revenue; mass unemployment, yuppies and most of all Greed.  <br/><br/>Foreigners may like the image the PR have painted of Thatcher, but in time her true image one which I briefly highlighted above will surplant the glossy one.
Her comment,<br/><br/> ?In my lifetime, all the problems have come from mainland Europe, and all the solutions have come from the English-speaking nations across the world,? <br/><br/>speaks volumes of arrogance, hypocrisy, and zenophobia that has kept nations apart for years. The "British only" solution isn't.
I read this with incredulity: "Despite the sectarian violence, Northern Ireland was not high on her agenda. Mrs. Thatcher saw the troubles there as intractable and her policies as simply preserving the status quo."<br/>THIS is all you have to say about Thatcher and Northern Ireland? Does "Bobby Sands" not ring a bell? 
For me, Reagan, Thatcher and Gorbachev are the political trifecta of my childhood. I think history will remember the three of them, and their impact on the Cold War, in a very special way. I certainly do. Margaret Thatcher was in so many ways a contradiction - an anti-feminist who became the absolute model for women in power - and an inspiration to a generation of young women whom she most likely would have never wanted to be. I think her legacy will in many ways be greater than her actual premiership. In any case, she is a woman and a politician to be revered and remembered. RIP.
I deeply divisive Prime Minister who will not be mourned by the British Trade Union Movement. In the late Nineteen Seventies Britain was being destroyed by rampant inflation, a lingering class system and bungling, lazy management. <br/><br/>Her greatest achievement was defeating the scourge of 18 percent inflation;  at the cost of destroying the industrial manufacturing base, creating poverty and allowing state school's to crumble<br/><br/>The Falklands war by chance was her electoral saviour, if the Argentians had only just waited awhile there would have been no Antarctic Patrol Ship and no aircraft carriers and hence no possibility of retaking the Islands without air cover.<br/><br/>She was responsible for the financial Big Bang in the City Of London [deregulation] that sowed the seed's leading to the present gobal financial crisis. 'The future lies in the service sector' was the mantra of her administration.<br/><br/>She was never Head Of State, a remark able political figure certainly. The comparison to Winston Churchill is pretty silly.<br/><br/>She will be mourned by some, but not by the Trade Union Movement, or those who suffered under her harsh monetarist policies.
Thatcher was lucky. Compared to all prime ministers of the United Kingdom before her, and all prime ministers of the UK after her, she was lucky. She came to power just when North Sea Oil was becoming a major source of income for the government. Oh, there had been a wee bit of income from it under James Callaghan, but it was just getting on stream then. Unlike all previous PMs of the UK, Thatcher had an enormous windfall dropping into her lap just as she took office. This enormous windfall, which no previous prime minister had, and no prime minister after her would ever again have to the same extent, was squandered recklessly. A majority of Thatcher?s own cabinet were opposed to spending on Trident nuclear missiles, but she pressed ahead recklessly. While Barrow-in-Furness gained a few jobs, for most of the rest of British industry, Thatcher was a disaster. She rejoiced in the destruction of established industries, telling everybody the future was in Britain being a global provider of ?financial services?. It was a mad project, bound to fail, and it HAS failed. Thatcher was lucky that the Thatcherite shift from producing things to ?financial services? didn?t collapse until long after she?d left office. But the fact remains, the enormous windfall of North Sea oil which fell  to her was squandered on Trident, on unemployment benefits, and on corrupt favours for her friends ?in the city?.  And Thatcher never at any time showed the slightest regret for her disgraceful actions.
Maggie Thatcher the Milk Snatcher. That's how I'll remember you.
Her legacy will live on for many generations to come. Rest in peace.
Mrs. Thatcher, excuse me, Barroness Thatcher, merits first place in the World-wide Order of Snobs.
This is Mrs. Castro:<br/><br/>Good timing:  I finished watching House of Cards, 1991, starring the late Ian Richardson.  I recommend it.  Most especially the scene where he, the PM, shot his old dog, putting it out of its misery while commenting that the National Health might take a lesson......
As an Irish American, I have to admit to a certain grim satisfaction at the news of Margaret Thatcher?s death.  Her treatment of the IRA hunger strikers, whom she let starve to death, coupled with her thinly disguised contempt for all things Irish, was simply reprehensible and helped to perpetuate rather than resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland during her administration.  As for so much else of what she did while in office, she was a daughter of the middle class who so desperately wanted acceptance by the British upper class that she sold out most of her citizens to get it.  So what if she became ?Lady? Thatcher: she was no lady, since she seemed to possess around as much empathy and human fellow feeling as a brick.
She took from the poor.  She gave to the rich.  She made sure the education and opportunities she enjoyed would not be available to other working class English.
Revered by some. Reviled by many more. 
It's telling that the first paragraph mentions her "victory" in the Falklands War among her accomplishments.  Is there anyone in the world but the far right who would want that on their resume?<br/><br/>The Falklands War was nicely summed up thusly: "Two bald men fighting over a comb."
Her terms were harsh but I lived in Britain before she came to power and the place was in chaos. It was a La La land that the left was running  it into the ground. It was a daily lottery as to who was on strike that day.<br/>British manufacturing was being destroyed by inept management and crazy unions long before Thatcher came to power. Anyone who wants a laugh should look up the history of  the Linwood car plant near Glasgow.  Hundreds of millions of pounds per year shoveled into a car factory that made cars no one wanted to buy.<br/>As for the coal mining communities , a good friend came from one in Scotland, they were finished. They were socially tight knit communities but what do you do with coal no one wants or could afford. Virtually every mine  was  a marginal operation and   everyone who worked there knew it.   I find it amusing all the good NYT liberals are promoting burning more coal for social cohesion. Perhaps they'd like to go on Windmill for Humanity in West Virginia.<br/>There is a lot about Thatcher that was undesirable but anyone who lived there at the time can tell you that the course Britain was on a floundering ship headed to the reef.<br/>She kept it off the rocks which was more than most could have done. 
Margaret Thatcher must be  remembered in two distinct category. <br/><br/>1- Capitalism establishment post war era  1970-2008<br/>2- Political ideology establishment. 1979-1990.<br/><br/>1- Thatcher and  her kind  reigned almost the last quarter of 20th century with  a notorious  attitude  backed with political ideology success. However what is established as a capitalism today is collapsed like  USSR. It brought down  western world prosperity with it. If there were any success for  ordinary people ,  today  everything  vanished. So unfortunately  Thatcher and her kind  favored capitalism didn't last long. <br/><br/>2- Pure political ideology, USSR  a cold war rival was beaten to ground, not communism. Why  not communism, because China prospered and took over so Chinese communism which even doesn't fit Marx philosophy succeeded. USSR was not all about Communism, there was a rivalry, nationalism , other side-ism was beaten. That  should be acknowledged as a political  success. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, let's don't forget who died from horrific disease of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy will never forget Iron lady for her negligence in this issue. <br/><br/>All in all 1980's was very fast revolving days, characters around the table  were colorful, dedicated, have will power. <br/><br/>Today we have Merkel, Cameron, Hollande and unknown Italians around the table and when we compare them to their predecessors at 1980's, new  guys are at best can be  labeled as "utterly incompetent" 
I lived in Britain during MT's first term -- she was a brilliant politician, brilliant leader. She literally saved Britain. The country was already divided -- that was not her doing. She lead from the front, not like so many leaders today.  
I was raised with the philosophy that if you cannot say something good about the recently departed, then don't say anything at all.  And even if you harbor unpleasant thoughts on the deceased, there are still diplomatic-----if not kind----ways to express them.<br/><br/>A human being named Margaret Thatcher has left this earth. She has made the journey we will all one day make. Like you, there will never ever be another person like her. <br/><br/>So, unless she personally made your life a living hell, why can't we just celebrate that very uniqueness which separates us as individuals yet binds us together in one-ness. It is not just one Margaret Thatcher we say goodbye to, but a part of ourselves.
Neither Thatcher nor Reagan are any kind of role models or heroes to me.  Reagan spent most of his term in a fuzzy muddled state of mind from Alzheimers doing what he was told.  I was in London last year and wandered all over but saw no evidence in kudoes for the woman.  That speaks tons.
A grand dame--I liked her, but not her politics.  Were I a British subject, I'd be a member of the Labour party.  Thatcher's revenge:  John Major.
Given Thatcher's harshly unforgiving tone towards her political opponents, I hope UK leaders resist any runaway Reaganesque "Legacy Project" renamings of everything in sight.  She doesn't deserve them any more than many of her overlooked contemporaries.
By going so hard after the unions, to some extent, she is partly to blame for the great loss of very good manufacturing jobs in the UK.  As someone who was born in the UK, I can tell you that during my lifetime, Great Britain was a leader in many areas of technology, until it essentially lost its manufacturing sector.  Now, a great many jobs there are in the service sector, and there is a decline in the pride of having British made products.  Do not just take my word for it.  The recent large scale riots in Great Britain demonstrate that the younger generation are not pleased with the outcomes of Thatcherism.  
Nobody gets everything right all the time. Maggie Thatcher was no exception. However, she was the right person for the job when Britain very badly needed a kick in the pants. RIP.
You'll never go wrong concocting political, social, and economic, rationalizations for giving the rich and powerful what they want.
She destroyed Britain's manufacturing sector and turned the nation into a service economy.<br/><br/>Sure, she'll be missed - by the 1%.
An evil, divisive woman. An earlier version of Karl Rove, whose strategy was to garner the support of the 40% or so who agreed with her by using dog whistle tactics on immigration &amp; painting her opponents as unpatriotic. She was the template for the Right of today minus the religious obsession.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the UK, the near 60% who opposed her were divided into two parties in England and three in Scotland and Wales. This was what provided her electoral success. She never obtained more than 44% of the vote but acted as if she had 100%.<br/><br/>She ruled in the interests of the south and south east. She left a trail of industrial destruction in the Midlands, North-West, North-east of England, Scotland and Wales unmatched since the Luftwaffe as entire industries like coal mining, steelmaking, shipbuilding were wiped from the map. <br/><br/>Virtually all Britain's problems today can be traced back to her. The casino capitalism which she encouraged. The isolation in Europe which she basked in as some kind of relic of empire. Even the benefits issue as she encouraged the take up of benefit for incapacity as it kept two million off the official unemployment figures. Even so, unemployment was at a post-war high for all of her eleven years in power. <br/><br/>There were race riots - almost unheard of before she became Prime Minister. She used the police to beat up striking miners. I for one will not mourn.
Elvis Costello summed up many peoples feelings about Thatcher in his song "Tramp the Dirt Down".
Britain's unions over-reached and Thatcher deserves credit for reining them in. But she went too far and hurt many people, especially England's poor. She was not, as some have said, "the greatest prime minister of the post-war period."  By far, that was Clement Attlee and the idealistic Labor Government of 1945-1951, which introduced national health insurance and many other beneficial programs.
Margaret Thatcher should have been charged with war crimes that she committed against Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland. She ordered the execution of Catholic lawyer Pat Finucane in 1989 because he was too successful in getting IRA members acquited from prosecutions. England has admitted that it was involved in his execution but has refused to engage a public inquiry because Thatcher would have been found guilty. She accused the IRA of being terrorists when, in fact, it was she who was the real terrorist.England needs to get its murdering soldiers out of Northern Ireland.
" (W)ho pulled her country back from 35 years of socialism"--During the 35 years before Thatcher became Prime Minister, the Conservatives ruled the country for 13 years, 1955-1964 and 1970-1974.
Thatcher went way too far in destruction of the labor movement.  
For many in Britain she was and is a divisive figure.  But for those Brits who have spent a lot of their lives working abroad as I have done, she was clearly an inspiration to people around the world, sometimes in the most surprising places.  I remember being in a meeting in Baghdad in 2004 with a group of Iraqi politicians discussing some ideas for projecting a unified vision for the Iraqi people after the fall of the Saddam regime.  One of them turned to me and said: ?what Iraq needs now is a Maggie Thatcher?.  I wonder how many of her adversaries in the UK realise how she motivated people around the world to believe that breaking the shackles of vested interests was not just desirable but actually realisable.  That?s quite a legacy.
Thatcher was a force of nature, a person who made life more interesting, though, in her case, no better. She called Mandela a terrorist; that is a succinct enough comment to contradict Obama's remark today that she was for freedom. Her economic policies, along with her buddy Reagan's, gave us the unfettered capitalism we have today. She could be ridiculous ('we are a grandmother'), sycophantic, ruthless, famously bellicose, and divisive. No one seems to comment that she had an extraordinary amount of luck that she co-opted to her advantage: the discovery of North Sea oil changed Britain, not Thatcher's policies, rescued it from near-bankruptcy in the 1970s. I hope we never see her like again.
I'm afraid my thoughts of Maggie are of a misguided soul with a lot of resolve, who proved the adage, "The world will step aside for the man/woman who knows where he/she is going." She put England on a path to elitism just as did Reagan and today's right wing operatives.<br/><br/>What a bunch of blather to celebrate these two! Why? Because she was a woman and had a school marm way that couldn't be resisted? And Reagan, because he was so familiar from TV and had a folksy charm? Results are what matters, and we got destructive and misdirected policies from both. 
All I remember is her being in lock-step with Reagan, and that is the beginning of the downfall of the middle class both here and in Britain. Her legacy? market over human values meh
Austin Powers' legacy is all that comes to mind ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxeH_OQpFw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxeH_OQpFw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxeH_OQpFw</a>
IMHO she delayed the inevitable demise of the British Empire by a few years at least. Did she sacrifice the lives of fellow Britons in doing so- sure. Better than sacrificing lives of enslaved people from other nations. Now or later- for good or bad- she will be remembered. That's more than what can be said of many today. RIP 
Margaret Thatcher was a disaster for Britain and an appalling example of women in power - she brought no distinction to her  gender and she is no loss to the World.<br/><br/>"She could stir almost physical hostility in normally rational people..." well it's fairly clear where Ronald Millar stood.  The fact is that any "normally rational" person with even a modicum of intelligence and compassion could not feel anything but hostility to her.<br/><br/>She and Reagan helped to cement the sort of mindless tyranny and ascendance of elitist materialism which has come to characterise Britain and the US.  The "blame the victim" mentality and disregard for those without accompanied by promotion of and accommodation of the wishes of those "with".<br/><br/>Her ignorant and xenophobic nationalism was a slur on the British people and the World, in the same way that the US's selective militarism and pursuit of illegal invasion and breaches of international covenants for its own ends has been and is a slur on its people.<br/><br/>That she managed to hang on to power by populist politics is not an indication of democracy at work but rather a demonstration of democracy perverted - just as it was in Australia by John Howard.<br/><br/>What we should learn from Thatcher's time in power is never to allow a similar situation again.<br/><br/>Certainly there will be no northerners grieving over her death.
Margaret Thatcher, a friend of business and everyone who works for a business, an enemy of labor bosses but a friend of those who work.
You bet we  here in the United States should pause and reflect on the death of Margaret Thatcher.   With our poll taxes, our hard nosed policies about unions, our attempt to destroy a public education system, and our mean-spirited and vicious attitude toward the poor and toward dis-abled returning veterans, we are well along the way toward an IRON-ruling government that  Margaret Thatcher would be proud of.
What David Lloyd George introduced during his tenure as Prime Minister of the UK from 1916 to 1922, laying the groundwork for the modern Welfare State, Margaret Thatcher sought to undo.<br/><br/>I suppose we need balance between liberal and conservative so that we don't go too far in either extreme.  I will always, however, favor the liberals.<br/><br/>I do admire Margaret Thatcher's pluck, her tough mettle.  And her speaking voice was charming to me.<br/><br/>10:32 a.m.
First thing I did upon hearing the news was turn on Elvis Costello's "Tramp the Dirt Down."
she was a neocon, super-conservative for whom the bottom-line seemed to matter more than humanity.<br/>she saw things from the top down, had little clue how the "small" people lived.<br/>an enduring example of poor leadership!!!
It isinteresting  to see the tributes from people who didn't have to live in her England. she brought the country closer to a second Civil War than anybody before or since. Probably the most divisive public figure in British history now and for a long time to come. 
Really World Loss Great Leader.There is no other leader like "MARGARET".Her committment  towards "REEDOM ,LIBERTY" is really great.My deep condolesence to Margaret Death. Even though She is not Physically but She alive in the Hearts of People.
I remember her cheesy little war against Argentina in order to retain one of the last bits of empire; The Malvinas. I remember her craven adherence to Reaganism, and his politics of hypocrisy. Tony Blair's her obvious descendant.
She was a great for some of her politics<br/>but her heart was cold and she didn't care that Belgrano ship was out of the war theatre she sunk it<br/>This darken all her legacy
Maybe they should rename the Reagan National Airport for her. The both of them were "cut from the same cloth".<br/><br/>No praise for selfish, anti-middleclass politicians, no matter where they come from. Phooey!
The point about Margaret Thatcher, the grocer?s daughter, free-marketeer and deeply divisive politician, was that she enjoyed being a woman and favoured attractive men in the same trade. (We should remember this in the light of the recent kerfuffle about President Obama and his praise of California attorney-general Kamala Harris?s looks and the stew about the New York Times's obit on rocket scientist Yvonne Brill?s beef stroganoff.)<br/>As Britain?s first and only woman prime minister, Mrs Thatcher was not above using dress as a political weapon. She saw no reason to deny her femaleness. In fact, she used it ? to great advantage. Mrs Thatcher was girl power before the Spice Girls. ?Being powerful,? as she said, ?is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren?t.?<br/>She dramatized herself most clearly as the ?Iron Lady? on January 31, 1976, using words to create an image that politically correct women?s rights activists would denounce as sexist today: ?I stand before you tonight in my Red Star chiffon evening gown, my face softly made up and my fair hair gently waved, the ?Iron Lady? of the Western world,? she told a dinner ?do? in her Finchley constituency.<br/>It was a half-mocking, half-gushing description that might have been straight out of Mills &amp; Boon. She meant it though, becoming ?the lady and the warrior?. She was Britain?s tough-love sweetheart and proof, if any were needed, is its complicated conflicted emotions about her even today.
Margaret Thatcher - to understate it - evokes very strong opinions. She came to power at a cusp, when the old ways were inevitably giving way to the new. Britain after losing most of its colonies - and therefore its income was living way beyond its means. State enterprises were draining the economy and globalization and new technology were radically changing the world of business.<br/><br/>Some will argue that privatization and free enterprise were a curse on the UK. But indisputably the standard of living has gone up in the UK and the western countries who followed this route. On the flip side of course so has uncertainty. Thatcher, Reagan and others successfully transferred risk from the State to the people.<br/><br/>However Mrs. Thatcher had nuance. She understood that while free market had plenty of merits certain functions were best served differently. She resisted privatization of British Rail and the British postal service. After some initial missteps she increased education budgets and opened up opportunities for all citizens to higher education. <br/><br/>She was farsighted to want some union with Europe but was wary of nation states effectively ceded their monetary and sovereign powers.<br/><br/>She formed effective partnerships be it with Reagan or with Gorbachev.<br/><br/>Her failures included her imperiousness and absolute conviction - which she acquired from hard study rather than focus groups - on what she thought was right. <br/><br/>Truly one of the seminal leaders of the 20th century. 
Thank you Maggie. You were one of those great figures during those turbulent times who were instrumental in bringing freedom to Eastern Europe, including the land of my ancestors, Lithuania. We will never forget you for this. 
Reagan would be turning over in his grave !
I can't wait to read the tirades pour in from the left about this GREAT leader.  She unshackled Great Britain from the slavery of government run socialized industry and policy unleashing an economic lion that was the envy of many in the world.  She defended freedom, although I'm sure the radical left will call her a warmonger, and she cautioned Great Britain about the coming European Union...an experiment in socialism that is failing before our eyes.  She believed in the power of the individual, and in the resourcefulness of the British people.  Those that wanted to live loved her...those that wanted a life given to them by the government never understood what she was doing for them and future generations to come.  
Legacy? She had countrymen and people from Argentina killed over hydrocarbons and sheep. No amount of national pride can reverse what was done in the Falklands. The last throes of a fading empire and she epitomized it. Now it's our turn to fade,who will be our Iron Lady? W?
"A friend of business, an enemy of labor"  should be her epitaph.
Thatcher, like her American parallel Reagan, did irreparable harm to her country. History will not treat either of them kindly.
In all fairness to Thatcher, the UK was an economic mess when she took over, with unions constantly on strike demanding excessive wage increases that fueled inflation that in turn fueled demands for further excessive wage increases. Inflation was out of hand, taxation confiscatory, the economy too heavily socialized. Such was the resultant malaise that I found visiting the UK in those years a depressing experience.<br/><br/>Sadly, Thatcher went too far in the direction of laissez faire and along with Ronald Reagan, set the stage for the situation we find ourselves in today -- a vast economic meltdown caused by financial industry deregulation, and jobs and factories exported to third world countries that pay starvation wages.<br/><br/>But I say give Thatcher credit where credit is due. Liberalism, taken to excess, can be as counterproductive as conservatism.<br/><br/>Left to its own devices, capital maximizes profits and labor can no longer afford to buy the goods it produces, leading to sluggish growth or recession. Left to its own devices, labor grants itself ever greater packages of wages and benefits while reducing productivity, and again, production suffers. The most successful period in economic history was the progressive era, when the forces of labor and capital were in rough balance, with both groups benefiting equally from robust economic growth.<br/><br/>Thatcher did the hard, unpopular work of restoring balance, something her predecessors did not. And for that, she deserves great credit.
I am greatly saddened by the death of Lady Thatcher.  I am British by birth, but I left my home country for overseas in 1974 for a better chance in life when the UK was in the thick of the woes of failed economic policies and the choking grip of the unions was on the throat of the prime minister of the time, Edward Heath (Mrs. Thatcher?s predecessor). <br/><br/>That grip steadily increased its strength such that by 1979, the leaders of the Trades Union Congress could simply telephone the prime minister of the day, James Callaghan (Labour), at any time and tell him that they were coming over to 10 Downing Street for a chat.  In essence, they were going there to dictate policy to him, so powerful had they become.<br/><br/> Mrs. Thatcher with great determination shattered that stranglehold and was able to remove a major impediment to economic revival in the UK.  Of course, she was fortunate that Paul Volcker and the Fed tamed inflation in the US, and the UK enjoyed the benefits of this.  But without the removal of the excessive influence and power of the unions, it is unlikely that the economic recovery would have been as strong.<br/><br/>Therefore, among the many positive lessons she taught is this: never allow any branch of government to lose it ability to act independently because of allegiances to ?special interests?.
The tributes to Margaret Thatcher emphasize her commitment to "freedom" and "liberty"--except, of course, for gay people. She was the author in 1988 of the infamous anti-gay Section 28 which stated that a local authority "shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality" or "promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship." It took until 2003 to get rid of it and the curse it put on gay people in Britain. And I don't imagine my brothers and sisters in the trade union movement will be mourning much today either...
Let the hagiography begin. As it did with the Reagan, the mainstream media's coverage of Thatcher will gloss over the truth in favor of personal stories of her courage, sticking to her principles, and strong leadership. Churchill similes will abound.<br/><br/>Caveat lector! I grew up in Ireland in the 1980s, next door to Thatcher's Britain. Let me assure the NYT readership that the reality was somewhat more sordid. The social and economic upheaval generated by Thatcher's unwavering adherence to hard-right policies was appalling to behold. She broke unions, ruined the NHS, pushed to privatize British Rail (which has since made train travel in the UK a nightmare), and introduced a poll tax to cut the poor out of the franchise. She allowed ten IRA prisoners to starve themselves to death -- one of them an elected MP -- while publicly proclaiming she would never negotiate with terrorists. As she did so, her government was engaged in secret negotiations with the IRA to end the crisis. She insisted on a squalid little war in the Falklands, even ignoring her friend Reagan, to help her get re-elected in 1983. She supported and visited Chilean fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet while he was in captivity in the UK in 1998-2000 and publicly lobbied on his behalf. She declared "There is no such thing as society." She could never contemplate being wrong.<br/><br/>And all this was done in the tone of a matronly lecture, as if she were straining her patience to engage toddlers, that grated on the nerves.
My condolences to the Thatcher family and the people of Great Britain.  In the Thatcher family's time of sorrow, I hope they will treasure her memory.   I do wish that people who disagree with her politics would not comment on them in an obituary, I don't think Miss Manners would approve.  Please wait unit an editorial is published, if there is one. 
She was merely the figurehead of an establishment who because of the demise of the previous Conservative government at the hands of the miners had a score to settle with the unions. In settling that score she destroyed manufacturing in the UK &amp; delivered our economy into the hands of the financial institutions with their insatiable greed that has lead us to the precipice of disaster where we find ourselves now..<br/>She will be missed only by the ignorant, uncaring or selfish among the UK population, and those too far away to make any worthwhile judgement.
She gave Britain back its pride!
I was born in 1979, the same year Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of Britain. By the time she left office eleven and half years later, I was just about to clock 12. But many years after, many people, even here in Africa, still remembered her as a strong, tough and charismatic woman. Many Africans really cared less and little about her financial and economic achievements in Britain. What people remembered the most here was the image of a great woman able to lead a major we3stern nation with strength and dignity, and sometimes surpassing men around her. It was only today after her passing was announced that a British friend of mine wished her a good time in hell. And I asked why? He then explained what the New York Times also explained, the other side of her. The tough policies that hit the poor the hardest and widened the gap between broke and rich in Britain, the suffering of millions of poor Britons. So, I am a bit confused as to what to say with these two conflicting images. Well, may her soul go where it deserve to be.
May we honor her legacy but re-commit ourselves to undoing her devastating attacks on working people around the world.  <br /><br />
I'll give Margaret Thatcher credit for being a strong, decisive leader who stood by her convictions and principles - very much like Ronald Reagan (even though I disagree with their policies and ideology).  <br/><br/>At the same time she lacked empathy and, while a visionary in some areas such as the Soviet leadership, she was very myopic in others, particularly the effect of her economic policies on the working families of her own nation. <br/><br/>I still give Sir Winston Churchill the nod over Lady Thatcher as Britain's most influential PM of the 20th century.
With all due respect, all I can say is "Out, Out, Out."<br/>Perhaps St. Peter may remember that one.
I'm reading a lot of "bad" comments, but wonder if she was so "bad" how was she elected 3 times? Don't the readers like democracy?
the Baroness, so many years<br/>well, do we cry or are there cheers<br/>Lady's not for turning<br/>sink that ship, it's burning<br/>let's curry xenophobic fears.
There is no doubt: Thatcher changed Britain more than any leader changed any country in Europe after World War II. It is a remarkable accomplishment. Those who came to know Britain in the 1970s, such as myself, would never have imagined there was, beneath this sleepy county in what seemed terminal decline in fact a very aggressive nation, more like the world Dickens knew. She somehow knew her country better than her critics thought. An extremist, sure. And she made many mistakes. But the state of Britain today, the state of both Labor AND Conservative parties, shows she remade this country and its politics forever, and that much of Britain continues to recognized itself in her picture of it. . 
Thatcher will be remembered by the poor as the person who felt milk was not necessary for children; the rich will no doubt sob and moan, since she did so much for their class. And to the rest, she will be known as the lady Meryl Streep played to get an Oscar...
Elvis Costello said it best in his song "Tramp the Dirt Down."  I recommend it to anyone wanting to appropriately remember Mrs. Thatcher. 
Condolences to those who revered her. To most Thatcher was a disaster. But for the west she was a goddess of money redistribution, to the top.<br/>Thatcher was less a conservative but rather in the American Libertarian mold: someone who wants police protection from his/her slaves!
Winter 1985. Foreign study for a year. Blowing off class at University College London to go to (I think) "50 Years of German Expressionism" at the Royal Academy of<br/>Art on Piccadilly. A Tuesday or some dead time. Rain of course. Not<br/>many of us there that day. Then I began to notice a lot of security.<br/>Guys in suits telling people to go to different rooms, etc. I was<br/>annoyed and surly; the typical art history student in black. I was<br/>looking at some bleak landscape painting when this annoying woman<br/>walked up and started talking to me. Ugh! I barely glanced at her and<br/>walked away. Total snub.  But as I walked off, I happened to notice it<br/>was none other than the Iron Lady herself, Margaret Thatcher. At least<br/>my Liberal fellow students were delighted that I didn't give her the<br/>time of day.  May she rest in peace.
Margaret  Thatcher was more beloved by Americans than the British because she shared with the US a materialist philosophy which British society had moved away from towards the latter end of the 19th century as a result of Enlightenment thinking: hence her obsession with returning to `Victorian values'.  When in office she quickly  set about putting back the clock of British social evolution 100 years by getting rid of the public service ethic and replacing it with `fat cats;'  privatising public utilities;  neglecting industry; removing public grants to Universities for pure research -resulting in a brain drain much of it to America; as Heath's Education Minister she had previously begun the spiral of deterioration in education standards from which we still suffer by closing several hundred of the excellent Grammar schools and replacing them with the present Comprehensive schools, etc.  <br/><br/>Thatcher was the least popular Prime Minister in recorded history up to the Falklands Factor but despatching the Task Force to retake the islands hugely raised her popularity assuring her party of a further two terms of office: not then understood was her secret negotiations with the Argentine junta at the time had largely resulted in the Argentine invasion by giving Galtieri cause to believe Britain wouldn't fight for the islands.  Given the perspective of time the British nation now have the measure of Thatcher and it is probably fair to say she is far less revered than despised today. 
She and RR changed the world---looking at what the conserevative parties of the UK and my country the US have ended up with---David Cameron and the younger Bush and  Romney--is depressing. 
The Margaret Thatcher I suffered destroyed entire regions of Britiain while focusing the wealth and 'freedom' in and around The City. She - along with Reagan - planted the seeds of all that has gone wrong in the financial sector.  The mobilizing of the fleet to 'The Flaklands' was a piece of absurdist theatre. Moreover, we now know that she did not want the Berlin Wall to fall because she feared the unemployed from the East. In short, I thought everything about her, from her phony invented accent to her hypocritical hectoring, was callow and mean.  She utterly lacked compassion and ripped the heart from the country. I am only sorry she is dead because I had hoped to  say these things to her face. 
Appears that the commies and Argentinean propaganda machines are out in force again. Baroness Thatcher defeated an evil military junta  that used to drop innocent Argentines from DC10 aircraft over the Pacific/Atlantic coast . Argentina, like typical south American conquistadores, ignores the wishes of the local Falkland Islanders to remain British. And why wouldn't they want to maintain links with Britain, a nation, unlike argentina, that doesn't default on international monetary loans and doesn't steal assets, as in the case of the misappropriation of Repsol YPF. Stolen from Spain like a COMMON street mugger. The real witch is Cristina Kurchner. A second rate, banana republic version of Imelda Marcos. <br/><br/>Baroness Thatcher imbued all hard working, non-socialists with a spirit of drive and determination. The champagne socialists, who cyclically bankrupt Britain, make a sport out of blaming everybody else for their economic ineptitude . RIP
I lived in London for almost two years while Mrs. Thatcher was in office and what I remember most was thinking that terrorism cannot be stopped (the IRA was very active at the time) and that I went to the doctor and the dentist free of charge although I was a poor struggling American student with no health insurance. I was a given, even by the Conservatives, that everyone had a right to health care.
The most divisive British politician of the twentieth-century. A friend of Pinochet. A woman who called Nelson Mandela a "terrorist."  A dreadful woman.
The right person at the right time. Just as Britain was about to go over the cliff with the unions running amok and the country approaching anarchy she steadied the ship of state and brought it back from the brink. She saved the country from a devastating socialist government who were taxing the country into oblivion and giving the unions everything they wanted.  Sound familiar? Now we here in the USA need a "Maggie Thatcher" to right the ship of state and stop the 'socialists' from spending us into oblivion. Deja vu ? Who will be our "Iron Lady" ? I hope we find one soon.
Lady Margaret Thatcher was to England what Ronald Reagan was to America.....We shall all miss her influence.....
King George the Third would have been very proud of her.  She fought for the British tax havens - Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, BVI - and convinced President Reagan that the dozen or so states that had adopted worldwide combined reporting needed to back off. Worldwide combined reporting (aka unitary taxation) included profits shifted to subsidiaries in foreign tax havens in a state's pre-apportionment tax base. If worldwide combined reporting had been adopted by every state, the status of her tax havens would have faded away and she knew it! Instead, the majority of states have now adopted water's edge combined reporting which excludes the US profits shifted to foreign tax havens. This is despite the US Supreme Court's approval of worldwide combined reporting per their Barclays Bank and Colgate-Palmolive decisions in 1994 (the vote was 7-2 and 9-0, respectively in favor of the state of California).<br/><br/>These United States fought Britain over taxation without representation. Margaret got representation without taxation. Billions of US profits have been shifted to British tax havens. We won the war for independence...or did we? 
I can't think of anyone other than Reagan I despised more in the 1980s.  And I still do.  They were people who rose to power on abstractions (so-called principles) without any sense of the millions of faces they were stomping on.  And that's not even considering Falklands.
Margaret Thatcher has shown woman president of a powerful country capable of sending young men to battle as easily as man.  
A Margaret Thatcher Republican, male or female, is what America needs right now - starting with a dismantling of the Obama Socialism path we are on just as Britain was going downhill until she rescued it.  
I do not agree with many of her policies, but admire her courage to stand by her conviction. Great Leader!
As a grocer's daughter, she understood the value of high turnover. I  bought a house in London during the mid 80s and it seemed as though the whole city was for sale. Along with Reagan, Thatcher ushered in the reckless speculative mentality, the selfish, money-rules culture, that has done so much damage to the economic and political life of both the U.K. and the U.S.
Helped lead the conservative tide that finally sank the world economy in the Great Recession. 
RE:  Her policies revitalized British business, spurred industrial growth and swelled the middle class.<br/><br/>Oh please.  Another instance of the NY Times catering to the right--made even more obvious by the comments so far  tagged as NYTimes picks.<br/><br/>This was a PM who was in a fact a big spender in during the Heath years (70 - 74),<br/>saw double digit inflation both at the beginning and end of her premiership, caused tremendous  socio-economic suffering with her daffy money supply manipulations as a way to fight economic stagnation and increased unemployment by nearly three fold in the procees, from 1 M to 3 M, when the former was a part of her campaign slogan of Britain was no longer working.  Growth rates under Thatcher were inferior to they were under the awful 1970s:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/nov/25/gdp-uk-1948-growth-economy" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/nov/25/gdp-uk-1948-growth-economy" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/nov/25/gdp-uk-1948-growth-e...</a><br/><br/>RWR<br/>OKC, OK
Thatcher didn't care about the average Briton. Both she and Reagan failed their countries. Privatization has proven to be an absolute failure in both the UK and the US.
Her contributions to a survival of the fittest ideology is hardly to be admired.  Her belief in individual freedom certainly did not extend to Mandela and black South Africans.  
opinions differ doncha know<br/>the Iron Lady's set to go<br/>she and Ronnie both<br/>doppelgangers loth<br/>the Union bashers, all for show.
She was iconic, not doubt.<br/><br/>If you lived through them, when you reflect on the 1980s, you think about MTV, big hair, early PCs, and Reagan and Thatcher.
Hey, at least the Times managed to get through this obit without commenting on the deceased's ability to whip up a mean beef stroganoff.
The formal end of an era that actually ended in 1990, when she lost the party leadership and the prime ministership, and to a new leadership for whom she harbored scant respect. The world will long remember not so much this date when we lost a truly formidable human being, but the impact she had on our world, which was impressive indeed. Even more than Indira Gandhi, she merited the title of greatest woman of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Margaret Hilda Baroness Thatcher: Resciescat in Pace. We've missed your ungentle but profound wisdom and strength for many years; and now we'll miss the rest of you, as well.
If there was anything positive to Margaret Thatcher it was that the Labour Party looked at itself and decided that it had to remake itself in order to win power. Thank you for that, Mrs. Thatcher.  
Like many right-wing politicians, Thatcher is more revered in the United States than in her homeland. The same goes for Tony Blair. Both pursued a neo-liberal agenda that, while jettisoning some useless baggage, did enormous damage to the economic and social fabric of the United Kingdom. For his part, Blair had a certain charm.  Thatcher couldn't even manage that.
Perhaps Byron's lines about another "hard" Tory PM, Wellington, are appropriate:<br/><br/>"If you have acted once a generous part,<br/>The world, not the world's masters, will decide,<br/>And I shall be delighted to learn who,<br/>Save you and yours, have gained by Waterloo?"
Hey don't blame the lady, does anybody remember the 1980's. USSR collapsed, mad cow soared. Vulture capitalism become standard of  free market.<br/><br/>We live those times and it was exciting.<br/><br/>R.I.P
This e-petition is short and sweet, but unfortunately closed for signatures. I understand her funeral will be privatized:<br/><br/><a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/18914" title="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/18914" target="_blank">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/18914</a>
I think the Falklands War got short shrift in your account. Her stance in that conflict shows that she was not just ready to bloody her opponents' noses figuratively, but to spill blood and spend treasure to defend a principle rather than negotiate or compromise.
I feel much more grief today at the death of the brilliant writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala than at that of a politician who once called Reagan "brilliant" (I don't think even Nancy Reagan ever stretched the truth that far), cozied up to dictators, started a ridiculous war only to pump up her own image (a lesson learned by Bush), and did all she could to destroy the middle class in her country.  
I can remember 1979 the year Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the UK. I was a a senior in high school then, and it was really a big deal even here in the USA that a woman was finally a head of state who wasn't just a figurehead. In those days it seemed as though women really COULD 'have it all' and from what I could see Baroness Thatcher came pretty doggone close. She had a devoted husband, two children, an interesting career and a full life.  Even if one didn't agree with her politics (and I didn't always agree), it can't be argued that "Maggie" earned her place in history.  RIP. May God make her memory eternal.
I was a student in Britain from 1984 to 1987 and was inspired almost daily by Thatcher. When I arrived, the country was in the midst of a miners' strike led by the loathsome Arthur Scargill, a Marxist who apparently wanted to turn Britain into suburb of the USSR. I could not discern any justification for the strike, and thought Thatcher handled it brilliantly. It was so reassuring to watch the evening new and listen to her. Every sentence, every paragraph was perfectly thought out. Thatcher not only revitalized Britain; she helped give the whole Western world new confidence. May she rest in peace.
Her famous quip about socialism said a lot about her character (or lack thereof).
The 1980's is truly over with the passing of Margaret Thatcher.<br/><br/>I bet there will now be a run on the movie Iron Lady from Netflix.  After all Meryl Streep owes her Oscar to Margaret Thatcher.
I lived in the UK during the Thatcher years and was dismayed, and often shocked, at the misery of British life. Thatcher and her cohorts rolled back the rights of all British "subjects": she instituted a crushing Poll Tax to limit democracy (tying the right to vote to paying the tax), made a bigger mess of the NHS than it was in the first place by trying to privatize it by stealthy methods and failing, and of course, waging war abroad, and refusing to deal with the human rights abuses of Irish Catholics.  Oh, and let's not forget her decision to allow Mad Cows Disease to spread into the human population rather than spend the money to check it at the slaughter houses. Her legacy will not be forgotten....or unfelt for decades to come.  
Thatcher inspired a lot of angry music that became a part of the sound track of my youth.  
@historylesson:<br/>I'm in deadly earnest. Together they destroyed the gulag and defended the principles of personal dignity and moral integrity, along with promoting a free society that does the same. I scan the horizon and see none afoot today to match them, sadly.
Her ?No! No! No!'? is still echoed across the Channel today by another lady..
I expect that both she and her good buddy Ronnie will fade into relative obscurity.  Like H. H. Asquith and Woodrow Wilson they were leaders at an important time but ultimately none left a lasting legacy of achievement.  Asquith and Wilson at least have the specter of a major war to hide their deficiencies in social and economic arenas.  Thatcher and Regan have no major wars to hide behind.  Rather their directing the economy to benefit the super rich has been a failure for the rest of us.  Even there they did not do enough to be remembered as either thinkers or doers. 
This daughter of a working class shop keeper, she went on to destroy everything the British working class had achieved, equal rights , trade unions etc.<br/> Dismantled the infrastructure , mining, shipbuilding, steel mills,. to name a few, she also sold off for a pittance the North Sea oil rights to her finantial masters depriving the British people of future secure and cheap fuel.<br/>   This evil woman will not be missed by the true workers.......just the Banskters.
Margaret Thatcher - One of the best leaders of the Britain.  This lady had stature,  legendary class,  that well represented Britain.  She created respect for her beloved country through out the world.   A true leader that will go down in history as one of the greats.
Historians will have an interesting time in deciding who left the greater legacy, Churchill or Thatcher?
i saw a picture of her with Reagan.  These were the two greatest leaders of the last 40 years for many reasons (include Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II).  And they were CONSERVATIVE.  No Democrat of that era or now can hold a light to them....current crop of Republicans either.   
My earliest political heroine. Rest in Peace.
US readers of these comments may not appreciate that the UK electoral process allows a political party to win huge overall victories in terms of parliamentary seats even though less that 50% of the people voted for that party. This is true of all of Thatcher's victories and Tony Blair's. In fact Britain hasn't been governed by a party that won over 50% of the popular vote for decades. 
The Iron Lady is gone. The Platinum One remains. Whether "playing" a Bond girl or coming out of the hospital looking better than ever, the Queen does her duties as head of state with grace and strength. <br/><br/>Dixie Swanson<br/><a href="http://wwwl.dixieswanson.com" title="wwwl.dixieswanson.com" target="_blank">wwwl.dixieswanson.com</a>
The epitaph on her grave ? "There is no such thing as society."
Thatcher was a traitor to her allies and all values of the Western World:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1934" title="http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1934" target="_blank">http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=1934</a>
" The problem with Thatcher and Reagan style vulture capitalism is that you eventually run out of suckers to fund your ponzi scheme's."<br/>  Just as US president Thomas Jefferson predicted.
"There is no such thing as society," she said in an interview to a lady's magazine in 1987. This encapulated her political philosophy and would be a befitting epitaph of one of the most divisive political figures of our times.
It seems to me that many comments are stretching credibility when they link Prime Minister Thatcher's policies and actions to the present in some sort of "A caused B" simplicity.  She was the peacetime Churchill - tenacious and implacable.  She generated a mix of positive and negative changes in the British economy and political culture.  She was larger than life.  On one point there can be no debate - she was a political figure of consequence that dwarfed the political pygmies of her day with her will, her intellect and her "take no prisoners" agenda.
Thatcher's leadership successes in helping bring down Soviet communism, restarting a stalled economy  and resurrecting English national pride are tempered by her having actively promoted institutionalized homophobia, greed and indifference to the plights of others.  <br/><br/>Future leaders will learn much from her examples, and hopefully improve on the final results.
As someone who grew up in Britain during the Thatcher years I will always be one of Thatcher's children. My world view was shaped by the divisions she created in the society she claimed not to believe in.<br/>She seemed to rely upon her image of being strong as opposed to being right, so that when she was right (unions, tax reform) she looked like a real leader but when she was wrong she dug herself very deep holes (poll tax, the IRA).<br/>How history judges her will undoubtedly depend who is asking the question. She was right on a lot of things but deeply flawed on others. She changed Britain by ripping it apart.<br/>A great leader, maybe. An important one, undoubtedly.
Was the election of an Argentinian to Pope what pushed this frail lady over the edge? Or did she even possess the mental faculties to appreciate the historical significance?<br/>I don't expect sorrow or condolences from Buenos Aires or Derry.
On a day when we lost a great world leader, the media continues to focus on the women who lead websites as if they are transforming the world by creating better apps and better news sites for our idle time. Margaret Thatcher helped change the world for the better. I doubt she ever thought about 'Lean In'. She just lead by her conviction. 
No mention of her Cromwellian efforts in Northern Ireland, huh? 
Odd, all these comments about how wonderful this woman was. She gutted the working class almost overnight in England. Northern England never recovered. I think  the nicest comment I have heard from my English friends is, ding dong the witch it dead. The anger towards her runs deep.<br/> Being strong doesn't mean your right. Interesting some of the figures in history we choose to give our adulation too. Many were people that caused pain, suffering and ruination.
Most of the issues with the Financial Industry we face at the moment have their roots in her and Reagan's politics. At first wanted to say that I find it sad that she never had to see what damage she caused (she wasn't really a part of the reality anymore the last few years) but actually I think she wouldn't have cared. May what ever deity she believed in have mercy on her soul.
What I admired most about Margaret Thatcher was the love she had for her husband, Denis.  Ironically, feminists at the time condemned Mrs. Thatcher for having the cliche' political marriage------devoted, adoring wife gazing up lovingly at politician husband during public appearances------only in reverse.<br/><br/>But she proved them wrong.  She showed that it was possible to be a strong wife too, and not at the expense of a 'weak' husband.  If her husband was gazing up lovingly at her, it was not out of cliche' stagecraft, but because he loved her.  And what was wrong with that.<br/><br/>She was the archetypal feminist, and the feminists didn't even recognize it. 
All in all Thatcher and Reagan had a very negative influence on the history of modern society creating more diivisivness by aggravating the gap between rich and poor.<br/>Britain would be better off today if  it  had planned for  a more social  and manufacturing based economy like Germany, instead of making the country too dependend on  services and finances.
As a college student in 1980 the world did not look all that promising in the US and I spent a year in the UK  ... and it was worse. You can't deny the reality of debt and protect inefficiencies and expect everything to work out --- someone has to pay for it. And no one ... unless forced ... Will!<br/><br/>People forget ... I'm 54 ,,,,,,,, Thatcher  was a long time ago but the cycle continues .. history repeats itself. <br/><br/>....... Look around in the 30 something crowd ,,,,,,  the next Thatcher better be lurking someplace or we are all in trouble.
One of the first and best Western politicians to try and divine the line between public wants and public needs.  She was pivotal and timely.  Unlikely we'll we her like pass this way again.  Pity. 
Her medieval politics crushed the unions--like Uncle Ronnie in the US--leaving the 1% richer than ever and the rest of us living like serfs. 
 Thacher increased UK unemployment to  3.3 million people while her bosses from the international banks applauded.
Margaret Thatcher and Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew are clearly the greatest postwar leaders that the world has produced.  If American presidents possessed 50% of her intelligence, the US would be in terrific shape.
One of my lasting memories of Margaret Thatcher, is when she<br/>thanked her good friend Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1999 for bringing democracy to Chile.  Pinochet: who had the lawfully elected President  of Chile, Salvador Allende killed, and who was directly responsible for the murder of 4,000 of Chile's citizens; Chileans who had the poor judgement to disagree with the destruction of their own democracy.
I hear she made a mean beef stroganoff.
Margaret Thatcher was a philo-Semite (the opposite of an anti-Semite).  She had five Jews in her cabinet, more than any other prime minister.  She was the first British prime minister to visit Israel.  Her parliamentary district, North Finchley (north of downtown London), had -- and perhaps still has -- a higher percentage of Jews of any other parliamentary district in Great Britain.  Among her Jewish cabinet members were Malcolm Rifkind, Nigel Lawson (father of Nigella Lawson, the famous food writer), and Norman Lamont.  Many of Mrs. Thatcher's economic ideas cam from such Jewish economists as Milton Friedman and Ludvig von Mises.<br/><br/>Richard Colman<br/>Orinda, California
Tramp the dirt down...
Elvis Costello can tramp the dirt down now. 
Thatcher inherited a country on its knees in 1979 - and she turned it around.<br/><br/>Blair inherited a country in an economic boom in 1997 and spent it into oblivion.
I agree with the comment above that she and Reagan undid the working classes, and the portrayal by Meryl Streep kind of downplayed that. Thatcher delivered the hatchet to the working class, used warped pride in Britainia to keep the Falklands, not really caring that she was making a useless war that killed many young Brits who did not live to anywhere near her years. She was a pumped up egotist who knew better than her male peers, and I suspect, as the first female PM of GB, she had a "get even" attitude behind many of her policies. <br/><br/>Had she ruled as Queen, instead of King George III when we were declaring our independence from Taxation without Representation, and desired freedom to worship who we wished, I suspect that she would have sent many more of her young fighting men to put us down and crush our ability to separate ourselves from monarchic rule.<br/><br/>As a  PM, she often acted as a harridan, and got her way by bloating the pride of being an English-speaking woman. British rule in India and elsewhere was brutal, but effective. Now they are just another democracy struggling to continue being one. The US of today has a lot in common with the UK of today. 
As someone who has always been left of centre and deeply resented what Thatcher did to British society, I can't pretend to be sad at her death as I disliked her and all she stood for intensely. Most of all I loathed her for sending a British task force to fight - and die - in the Falklands just  to up her poll ratings.  BUT I did once find myself defending her when my mother claimed that it was wrong for a woman to be prime minister. Also she did give Meryl Streep the opportunity to act her socks off with her convincing and sympathetic portrayal of The Iron Lady. 
Prime Minister Thatcher and President Reagan brought prosperity and pride of country back to their respective nations. They were great patriots and had the courage of their convictions. Both are missed, and would be the perfect leaders  to solve the economic and moral problems facing us today.
The savior of her country.
I was overseas from '78- to late '81, and visited the UK several times back then. I was also stationed at a NATO post when Baroness Thatcher came to power and listened to her first major speech on the BBC as she took over as PM. It was like listening to the feminine voice of God, and clearly the tone of a tough leader. It was a time when the UK had broken down as a country, with continual strikes, trash in the streets, regular power outages, etc.  In '81, while in London, we stayed at an unfortunate hotel down on its heels in which many guests were unemployed. We thought they would hate the her. We were shocked when most of them said the draconian measures she'd instituted needed to be done because their country had fallen into chaos. Even though they were down, they were hopeful because their PM was fearless and willing to make the difficult decisions. I thought it was interesting that Katy Kay (NOT a conservative) of the BBC mentioned this morning that Thatcher had, however, broken down some of the class system in the UK by extending credit opportunities to small business owners, and expanding UK's then small middle class. Thatcher was a major actor in bringing down the Iron Curtain, and should be remembered for that as well. It's all incredible when you consider she began her life as a grocer's daughter studying chemistry at Oxford.
I'm always fascinated by those that swim against the tide and she certainly did that to great effect. My prayers to her family upon her passing.
People can say a whole lot about Margaret Thatcher but no sensible person can deny her intelligence, whit, and influence. The fact is that she was Prime Minister for 11-years as a woman in the years of 1979-1990. She stood up to totalitarianism and was a force one did not want to reckon with. She was truly a transformative and vital leader of our time. Like her or hate her, the Iron Lady has her place cemented in the history books.
This woman was a butcher in the Falkland war while trying hard to be as tough as any man!<br/>Thatcher had her navy sink a ship that was in retreat killing many men.
Brava, Ms Thatcher!  You were a strong, independent woman, who was an inspiration to women everywhere.  May you rest in peace.
Let us not forget that she dismissed Nelson Mandela and the ANC as "terrorists." The only commendable action she ever took was to decline a visit from Sarah Palin, but I doubt she was lucid enough to have made that decision herself.
I grew up and until recently lived in the county of Yorkshire, a former industrial heartland that she has socially and economically wrecked with for generations to come. I would suggest that the Anglophiles on this comment board look a little beyond her posture and blustering at an international level and look at the fact that she held working class Britain, a massive segment of the population, as beneath contempt, peasants whose futures and livelihoods were irrelevant. Go to an former mining town, where once vibrant close knit communities are in advanced social decay. Then you might see what a wonderful leader she was. No tears from me sorry Maggie
The confluence of rapacious capitalism with ephemeral individual freedom is Thatcher?s legacy, and a heavy burden to be borne by the working class.
Mrs. Thatcher didn't exactly remake Britain -- she began the work of slowly destroying it, as did her friend and our president, Reagan, begin the work of destroying our democracy.<br/><br/>It never fails to astonish me that these two are so lionized. For what? Carrying on about free market capitalism and rugged individualism? Destroying the working class by busting unions and the hard won protections unionization gave workers? Creating the path to oligarchy instead of democracy? What is there to praise about two people who were broken records on two subjects: hatred of communism, and the joys of unregulated capitalism?<br/><br/>Even their "wars" are comparable. I mean, really, The Falklands and Grenada? Please.<br/><br/>The utter mess the world is in now can be traced back to them and their capitalist obsessions. They started us down this path that rejected every single lesson learned since the end of WWI. <br/><br/>Thank you, Mrs. Thatcher. And you, too, Ronnie.
Such was the persona and charm of this iron lady of steely resolve that while alive she never allowed any vacuum to arise in Britain's' public life, and now in death, she leaves behind a big void difficult to fill. With her firm conservative convictions, and clarity of political vision, the way she presided over the political and economic fortunes of Britain for over a decade was truly remarkable. It was not for nothing that the whole saga of her public life and actions was sought to be encapsulated under Thatcherism, her own school of thought. May God bless her peace in death.
Since Churchill, three people have done more than any others to keep alive the principles, values, and dignity of Western civilization: Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and John Paul II. While I grieve the Baroness' passing, I hail the great good she has done us all.
Among her many accomplishments was her government made it illegal to discuss being gay in schools and colleges? It tried to legally intimidate all gay groups from even existing?
The world has lost a great lady.
The Falklands.  Right up there with winning World War II in the imagination of the Conservative Party mythmakers.<br/><br/>Churchill she was not.<br/><br/>Beating up on a country way less powerful than you and sinking their one battleship?  Playground bully sounds more like it.<br/><br/>Ideologues make a habit of finding and inflating a ferocious enemy in countries their constituents couldn't find on a map.  (Where is Nicaragua, anyway?)<br/><br/>Absolutism in politics is the people's worst enemy.<br/><br/>We should all beware of slogan-spouters who hold the line for the sake of winning elections.  Britain can thank the Iron Lady in large part for the loss of their great manufacturing tradition and the greed-fueled wreck of their financial sector, just as America should look to the Great Communicator and the Compassionate Conservative for the roots of our still-smoldering recession.<br/><br/>Sadly the Dogma Hounds of History have a way of rewriting things to create heroes where there are mostly just One Note Samba Singers of cant.
"There is no such thing as society!" Sure, and she did her very best to try to make sure of that, but most of us keep being decent human beings anyway. And so, bring in the psychiatrists and priests to explain these twin tragic characters, Thatcher and Reagan, both from the wrong side of the tracks, used by those who own our Anglo-American world to promote a class agenda that neither really had the capacity to really understand. But we are beginning to understand and the call of history - the call of a better future - is relentless. Frankly, their fall from the contrived pedestals that corporate media has placed them on is breathtaking to watch. This human rants with all due respect and condolences to her grieving family, for there is such a thing as society.
Extraordinary to publish an obituary of Thatcher that makes no mention of the Falklands War
Margaret Thatcher may have never been a fully-functioning person. She died long ago and it was fitting that her physical end was punctuated by her slow decline into the silencing of alzheimers disease followed by a stroke. Until she was rejected by her own so-called conservative party, she always seemed to be lacking humaness within her pretendings to be human. I suspect that most Brits would not vote for a repeat performance!
You don't have to wish her RIP. She was incarcerated in her repellant solitude through her later years. After all was said and done, and after all the sound and fury, that's where she put herself in. All's well that ends well.
Smarter and braver than Reagan, she gave England and the world a dose of the right medicine for the times.  Too bad it was all taken too far in the years after her departure from power.  They should name something in the Falklands after her.
She saved Britain's economy but her legacy is so divisive because in the process, the gap between rich and poor became (and continues to be) so extreme in Britain.  Her point of view about Europe though is something a lot of people agree with.<br/><br/>I didn't respect all of her policies but one thing I will say for Thatcher: she knew how to lead.  No dithering, no faltering and she had a sometimes terrifying steely resolve.  She was one of the last politicians you could look at and know exactly what she stood for.  I can't imagine any other politician, even during this recession who would make a statement like "The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money".  She spoke her mind and did what she promised to do when she was elected- I respect that and very few politicians do the same.
She certainly changed the course of history in the UK. Single handedly, she;<br/>destroyed the mining industry (remember Orgreave),<br/>all but destroyed British manufacturing,<br/>laid the foundations of the banking crisis by deregulating them,<br/>encouraged an extremely selfish attitude which persists today,<br/>sent many soldiers to their deaths herself and by establishing the 'special relationship' boxed Blair into Iraq,<br/>paid for this by selling back to people who already owned them the public utilities- resulting in windfall receipts used to reduce taxes on income to an unprecedented 20% (which successive governments are reluctant to face up to),<br/>resorted to a typical female trick when it all came home to roost- she cried.<br/>Ahhhhh.<br/>I wonder what kind of epitaph would be appropriate?
My mom said you should not speak bad about recently  deceased persons. I will take her advice. 
As I remember it, she was deposed not over opposition to European integration, but over her proposal to replace some property taxes with a head tax (so many pounds per person). This is the most regressive and unfair sort of tax there is. Even her own party understood that this idea was totally bonkers.
I'd like to write on her grave: "Hundreds of pointless deaths in Las Malvinas rest on my conscience".
"Don't go wobbly on me  regarding Iran now, Bibi." 
Margaret Thatcher was unique. Her quotations are priceless. <br/><br/>Her advice is timeless. <br/><br/>For kicks, try the one about habit leading to character, then reflect on her view of socialism. Give thought to her view of being liked. <br/><br/>Find a single politician today that can approach her majesty. <br/><br/>Define enabling. Proceed on course. <br/><br/>Maggie Thatcher loved Ronald Reagan, it seems. <br/><br/>Opposites attract. <br/><br/>See Dwight David Eisenhower and Harry S Truman. I'd guess she would have respected and loved each of them. 
I just feel that the movie that was made about her was the height of cruelty and insensitivity -- it seemed as a result of that movie and the way it shamelessly harped on her old age (hey, we all get old, leave her alone!)  she was already dead and her real death anticlimactic. So unfair to her, I hope she never saw it; anyway, she apparently suffered from dementia (also driven home to us in the movie) but her family had to see this, humiliating,, appalling and sickening in its intrusiveness -- is nothing sacred anymore?
She shall be forever respected as one of the greatest lady i have ever known
Revered by whom?  <br/><br/>The 1% maybe, and certainly Rupert Murdoch and his gang of merry men (and women) at the now defunct tabloid.<br/><br/>This reverse Robin Hood should be forgotten  as quickly as possible.  Ask the 99% if you have any question.
Lean in!
She presided over the degradation of the United Kingdom into a second rate power by letting international corporate interests cannibalize the national industrial base.  She also fell asleep at the helm of Commonwealth immigration policy leaving England with a permanently disaffected population.  I hope we can change course from Reagan-Thatcherism before we ground out in a backwater like the UK's ship of state.
Yep, she helped usher in the winner take all school of class warfare, as always, a faithful, but pale shadow of what has transpired in the US.   
Many stirring eulogies to Mrs. Thatcher will fill the air in the days ahead, citing her plucky resolve, steely political nerve and eventual betrayal by her own party's hacks. But what she ought to be remembered for -- along with her great friend Ronald Reagan -- is the mindless deregulation of the financial industry that led directly to today's global economic crisis. 
Margaret Thatcher - A titan in British politics, who was never afraid of controversy. Love her or loathe her, she shaped Great Britain country as few others did. Arun Paryadath.
Although I have no doubt that Margaret Thatchers political views were sincerely held. I cannot admire her she helped,to usher in a "greed is good" mentality which we are struggling to recover from. Also she was almost a complete philistine whose almost complete disregard for the arts and culture has also left a wounding legacy
In 1945, the British people voted out Winston Churchill, the man who led them through the war, and elected Clement Attlee creating a socialist state that turned the UK into a nation of losers. Thatcher reversed that. 
Ms. Thatcher always reminded me of somoen who lived Goldwater's quote.  "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.  And moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.?  But the best one, that the oh-so-wise progressive fascists of today skimmed over in their history classes.  "The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money."  - Margaret Thatcher
She has been my idol ever since I was a little girl, and I always dreamed of meeting her. As a young conservative woman, I fear there are not many who encapsulate our philosophy and political ideology in the way she did. She broke so many barriers and was admired and respected for her brilliance, charisma, and political savvy. I will definitely miss her!
MT you rock! And people say Hillary is an inspirational woman?
She may be gone, but her destructive spawn live in.  The current bunch in Downing Street are wrecking the UKs already fragile economy, priviatising the NHS (at the behest of US insurance companies and HMOs which are licking their chops), and in their zeal for tearing down the welfare state have proposed benefit cuts that remove 48% of income from the UKs poorest 10%.  I am sure she would approve of it all.
The worst leader in living memory tag comes to mind.she brought the country to its knees,And she lit the flame of Scottish nationalism. 
What a shame Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton didn't reign simultaneously (1979+)...she as Prime Minister and Hillary as President of the US.  Then, they both would have left a legacy and a far better world for others to build on. Margaret as Iron Lady did it alone, while we in the US still wrestle with whether a woman should be VP (and I decidedly don't mean Sarah Palin.)  We've got a lot of catching up to do to be on the same level as Britain.  They apparently just stick to weighing quality...not gender.
RIP dear Margaret and a great bravo for an inspirational life lived.....
Margaret Thatcher will be remembered for her betrayal of her Majesty?s loyal subjects in Hong Kong by surrendering Hong Kong to China. 
Revered? I was in London in the late eighties and asked a London "Bobbie" for directions to 10 Downing Street, he told me that it was closed to the public for security reasons and "Who would want to see HER, anyway?"<br/>She and Regan were a pair who changed both the UK and the USA but not for the better,
The Churchill of our times.
De mortuis nil nisi bonum, I suppose. She was more intelligent than Reagan but part of the same movement toward rock-hard right-wing ideology. I can't mourn her death, but I do regret her career.
Can someone name a politician who ISNT "divisive?"<br/>Obama is CERTAINLY devisive.<br/>George Bush...ditto<br/><br/>Overused and meaningless adjective.
It will take a long time to undo the damage this lady managed to inflict on  Great Britain.  Even more disasterous than the damage caused by the Reagan years in this country.  
My favorite Thatcher quote, to paraphrase, ?The problem with Socialism is eventually you run out of other people?s money.?<br/><br/>A classic!
Farewell!
Hillary Clinton - you're no Margaret Thatcher.
I just read that Margaret Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925 - the same day as Lenny Bruce....Lenny and Maggie.

The Greatest British Leader of Modern Times. R.I.P. Maggie!
Very strong and yes, she did destroy trade union power and brooked no cheek from communist upstarts but she also destroyed the UK manufacturing industry. Now we are, as Napoleon said, a nation of shopkeepers.
My favorite Thatcher quote.  To paraphrase, ?The problem is Socialism is eventually you run out of other people?s money.?<br/><br/>A classic!
Love her or loathe her - you couldn't ignore her.
  Not being right didn't stop her very often. She did not seem to care about what Britons wanted, but had her own ideas of what ought to be done. Resolve is less admirable when separated from the well-being of one's constituents. It constitutes obstinacy, in essence. 
It has been conventional wisdom now for several decades to consider Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagen as high-quality political leaders.  And that is probably a sensible evaluation, mainly because of the atrociously incompetent other political leaders that we have been suffering for far too long.
A shout out to Saatchi and Saatchi who ran her publicity and ad campaigns
Lean back, not  the " Iron Lady"!  The baroness is an iconic figure, that will glow on in perpetuity.  
Margaret Thatcher is a splendid example of being very likeable but very wrong.  May she rest in peace
I personally didn't care for her politics or her ideology. But she was a tough lady who proved that she could hold the reins of power in Britain at the height of the Cold War. A truly fascinating individual.
The article states that Mrs. Thatcher was "revered."  Was she "revered" by the Labor Party?  
She is one of the greatest leaders in our time. May she rest in peace and in love from all of us! I wish we have one leader just like Lady Thatcher in the States!
I am reminded of what transpired in Trafalgar Square around the base of the Nelson column immediately after it was announced that the Conservative Party had removed Thatcher from office. Over one hundred thousand gathered to dance and sing "Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead".  Like Ronald Reagan, Thatcher was far worse in reality than her publicity. The impoverishment of the British working class is her memorial as it is Reagan's here.
The world has lost a great leader...she had strength, guts and brains, something that the current  leaders of the free world lack...they could take a few lessons from her.
