Having just downsized from a house into a condo, with you guessed it, few and small closets, I can attest that ridding yourself of "stuff" is - exhilarating. Here's to fewer and smaller closets. It does a soul good.
My 6 x 10 room is definitely closet-like, but with a window. It's certainly intended to be a bedroom, but has no built-in closet of its own; at the time this building was built, most people had armoires and wardrobes to store their stuff. As a matter of fact, a couple of years ago I was able to get a wardrobe that is now packed to the gills with clothes, shoes, appliances, and anything that will fit. <br/><br/>A few years ago I looked at an apartment in the Sugar Hill (145th street) section of Harlem, and it was a renovated railroad flat that they had made into a studio with a walk-in closet?which even had a small window. Although it was a Section 8 apartment, clearly the landlord was forward-thinking enough to realize that people in every socioeconomic class have stuff to store?and if you can avoid using some warehouse like Manhattan Mini-Storage, you can save a few bucks. In retrospect, though, I think that closet would have made a great bedroom.
Here's one way to double your closet space: Get a divorce. It was a benefit I hadn't thought of.
I find it amusing that some people in NY are so blessed that they can afford such an extravagance for storing their stuff. And those of us who are less blessed perhaps can acquire such a deluxe abode and rent out the super closet to a needy student or to one of the homeless.
I certainly agree with a lot of the posters about the 'material' aspect of this article.<br/><br/>But on a side note: Having spent so much money on an aquarium, closet, etc., one would think the wires and pump would be concealed; even though it's on the 'closet' side.
My parents considered an expensive addition to add closet space to their home. Apparently, 4 huge walk in closets, two attics, and two garages, and 3600 sqft of living space were inadequate!  This was one time when I didn't keep my mouth shut...and they didn't move forward with it.
Everyone lighten up. If someone wants a closet to fill with lots of clothes fine . Let everyone live and be well . We don't need everything published in the NYT to be a class warfare issue. It's just stuff.
Why does this guy need a closet? He's dressed like a hot dog vendor.
Imagine if more closet space  was  an issue in the 80's.  George Carlin's'Stuff'' routine would definitely had an added dynamic.
The story is not about closets - part of my childhood was spent in a middling co-op in Queens, and we had a bunch of large closets, including two walks ins.<br/><br/>The story, as usual, is that Manhattan real estate is crazy, because closets are actually a "thing". Sigh. 
Proof positive that our society has lost its value systems when bigger is better, greed rules, and the "more, give me more, I want more, I deserve more"  attitude is a mantra chanted by so many in the the young generation who do not know what "work" is, who do not know the meaning of "ethics" and who have been coddled and spoiled since birth.<br/><br/>More swift kicks in the rear would do wonders.
I do not understand all those sanctimonious comments here. Everyone should have adequate closet space. Sure, you can get envious looking at one of the photos  in this article -- but is that a reason to hate everyone who has more closet space than you do?<br/><br/>To equate closets with luxury is silly. Poor and middle-class people need closets just as much as the rich do.  If you can't store things, you constantly have to buy new stuff. Different seasons call for different type of clothing; holiday activities and hobbies that make our lives more pleasant all require storing all kinds of "stuff"; family heirlooms need to be preserved; books, papers, toys, pets paraphernalia, athletic and travel gear -- all need to be stored and take quite a bit of room.<br/><br/>All of those things are not just for 1% for pete's sake -- it's a part of normal living for 99%. <br/><br/>Instead of criticizing people with closets -- all of you folks should be emphasizing the importance of closets to people's quality of life. 
There have always been super-wealthy people.  The difference is that many tried to hide their wealth from the eyes of any but their own circle.  One cannot imagine Babe Paley allowing her closet to be photographed and her shoes and handbags counted.   But today's super-rich have an in-your-face attitude and want their consumption to be as conspicuous as possible.  Frankly, it's disgusting.  <br/><br/>No human being on earth could possibly need 1000 prs of shoes.  It's bad enough that this woman buys them and an immense wardrobe, but when she pays more money to rent an apt for her clothes than most folks will ever earn in a year, it's obscene.  <br/><br/>I find it interesting when I go to LA or NYC from my modest Midwest city, that most women shopping look horrible -I make more of an effort to go to Target than they make to shop at Bergdorf's.  Then one goes out to a very expensive restaurant and again folks look like they just finished cleaning the garage.  Where do they wear all these horribly expensive clothes they must convert a bedroom to hold?  I don't think most ever wear any of it - I think they buy it for their imaginary life.  One woman on an Internet designer purse forum actually admitted that she does just that.  And this woman  spends $50,000 to $70,000 on hand bags alone, carrying only a couple of them.<br/><br/>There is something very wrong in such a picture.  Such a wasted, vapid life.  At least the robber barons of the early 20th century built public libraries and art museums.  
I would recommend these people get off their high horses and buy a small house in Queens, where they have probaby never been, and forget trying to stuff their STUFF into such small spaces. Better yet, get a life and get rid of all that stuff you don't really need! Use your money another way, like to help people maybe? We don't seem to have this problem out here in our small attached house way out in an outer borough (accessible by subway, and with plenty of room and shopping...join us!). 
All that "stuff" is disgusting. For God's sake, people are living in dumpsters and cardboard boxes!
some of us rent storage units<br/><br/>some of us have multiple family members<br/><br/>some of us have family heirlooms<br/><br/>some of us are not minimalist ascetic monks at all <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>the article started with the example of a MORE capacious closet that was rejected because it was less permanent looking<br/><br/>which means this is not about closets at all or  stuff at all but about the psychology of apartment design<br/><br/>and there are always rich people <br/><br/>and poor people are hoarders too<br/><br/>but trust the vast left wing echo chamber here to convert everything to class warfare<br/><br/>my class warfare is against thieves, ie redistributionists
It is really not the closets that are the problem per se. It is that everything built nowadays is so open and streamlined that there are few nooks and crannies to store stuff. If you put it out on a counter or in a corner, now it looks out of place or draws undue attention.<br/><br/>I go into newer homes or apartments even ones with lots of square footage , and I wonder where I would put a cat box so it's not just out there for all to see, or where to put a coatrack or where to store my luggage, and really, there's nowhere. But if you go into older homes, there's a space by the fridge where you could put brooms or a vacuum, a notch near the entryway perfect for a table to put keys on, an alcove off the living room where you could stack a collection of board games.<br/><br/>The open floor plans of today have a lot of advantages, but one big disadvantage is that everything you don't want to showcase has to go in a closet. Everything else in the home is on display.
While I enjoy reading the NYT out here on the Left Coast - I think its a much better paper than anything in SF or LA - articles like this reinforce the image of NY and NYC as nothing but a bunch of UBER-absorbed, self-centered, UBER-obnoxious and totally clueless to the rest of the country and the real world people.<br/><br/>I have very little sympathy for the plight of those in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, who would probably run screaming like a little girl from the Morlocks - er, the people that are rooting through their garbage for recyclables - every day.
I went from a person with 250 pairs of shoes to one. What I need now, and always have, is more room for toys. Wide built in shelves that can easily be converted to books or knick knacks. But most convenient for loads and loads of toys for the grandkids. It's how I roll.
Not worth a story in the NYT. This story is more wasted space. These closet obsessed people are so 20th Century. Join the new world, folks.
Having lived in the UK for years, I have to agree: Wardrobes are absolutely no replacement for a proper closet.
I  agree that there is too much consumerism out there. Even so, I've found that once you've lived in a place for a period of time, you will accumulate stuff. I will go through my closet and still have lots left over to put back. And I am one of those people who would sacrifice other space for a decent sized  closet. 
The very idea of needing all this space to hold so much stuff sends a shiver down my spine. I periodically need to purge my own belongings because I dislike being tied down to my material belongings.<br/><br/>Our identities should not be based on what we have, but who we are and the good we do in the world. <br/><br/>Let's all remember: you can't take it with you.
I have found that when I need a storage or organization solution, the problem is usually too much stuff and purging is the answer instead of buying yet another plastic storage bin. 
I love stuff!  Let's hear it for closets.  
Completely agree with Ilene! The "burden" of having so many valuable things... it's just well, not that interesting. The interest in this issue and this article (and what made me open and read it) is who are these people that have these issues (voyeurism!) and how is the NYTimes covering it so that it is interesting. I guess there is enough interest if this warranted an article.
Of course, the people in this article are completely over the top, but I hope those criticizing them aren't doing so from the comfort of large suburban homes. <br/><br/>I live in a 650 sf NYC apartment with my fiance and our cat. I work from home, with tons of books and binders everywhere. <br/><br/>It is a daily struggle to find places to store our items. The following disparate item live in our one medium size closet:<br/>- winter coats<br/>- cat litter<br/>- camping backpacks<br/>- wedding dress<br/>- beach towels<br/>- regular clothing<br/>- 6 pack of paper towels<br/>- Christmas tree stand<br/><br/>I love NYC! But the constant climbing on chairs to stack things to the ceilings, storing things behind sofas and never getting to shop at Costco, does get really old. 
I couldn't understand the point of this article at first -- suddenly closets are a huge concern for apartment hunters? Haven't they always been as important as the kitchen and bath?<br/><br/>But then the piece's real purpose emerged: a nauseating litany of uber-rich consumerist lifestyles, and how to accommodate their mountains of stuff. It's all quite vulgar, not to mention unhelpful.  
In NYC the apartment itself was the closet....

I look at that room full of shoes and I wonder what they pay their housecleaner? Their nanny?
Such pitiful indulgence. Lets fill those closets with clothes, shoes, jewelry and trinkets. All made in sweatshops by workers paid exploitative wages.
Mine is like a treasure box where I'm always uncovering new stuff. Just the other day I<br/>came across a bag of McDonald's fries with a receipt from three months ago.<br/>I thought rhey were still good and tried to feed them to the dog, but she wasn't having any.<br/>Probably needed more salt.
The bedroom in my first NYC apt was a converted closet. Advice: learn to use the space above, and get rid of stuff you don't need or rarely use.
Inasmuch as obscenity is defined as speech having no redeeming social value, then these closets can only be described as obscene. Can we please make a bonfire of this form of vanity ?
Just a bunch of greedy Americans. Looking for space to store more clothes than they will ever wear  while kids go hungry and there is more homelessness than ever. Donate some of that to charity.
Another French Revolution, please, and the bigger the better. 
Sometimes it is mind-blowing how the New York Times, like Manhattan itself, appears more and more to be something about and for the rich. 
Gag me with a spoon!  We're supposed to feel SORRY for folks who don't have enough closet space for their STUFF? People who have so much moolah and long green that they're morphing their Manhattan bedrooms into closets, turning the half-baths into closets, installing through wall to living room peep-show aquaria in their closets?  When the entire world outside the island of Manhattan doesn't have a pot to pee in?    Please give those of us without disposable incomes something less vomitrocious to dwell on in the New York Times Real Estate Section. Only when these bedroom-into-closets packrats (read:  hoarders) realize that life isn't THINGS to stored and hung in closets - that joy doesn't rise from stuffed closets and texting, twitting, facebooking contact with fellow human beings who are shuffling around the same mortal coil - will they realize that less is more,  and joy doesn't smile upon those who have the most stuff when they turn up their toes, buy the farm and shuffle off to Buffalo.
People with too many toys. This must be terrible
<br/>We can buy babies too. What a world. 
Consumerism at its worst.  Who needs that much "stuff?"  Kind of a sad reflection on our society, not to be self-righteous, but things do not make you happy.
When I see starving war-veterans freezing to death on the street, I think to myself, "Why don't you just go live in one of the apartments where you keep your designer shoe collection!"  I mean really, it's so simple, do I have to do all of the thinking for everyone?!?  
It's a fine thing that The Times Real Estate section has done in recognizing these people and their closets! Bravo! Their accomplishments no doubt match their sparkling fun-loving curious and adventurous life styles! Great. <br/><br/>Can you do something on gun racks next?
I love the Times, but sometimes these in depth articles on the trifling non-problems of the 1% living in Manhattan and Park Slope drive me crazy. Does this really merit a three page article on the front page?
All I can think about when reading this (which was not worth my time to finish) is children without food, healthcare, or homes at all. 
Rich peoples issues.....
I used to find articles like this fascinating.  Now...I don't know.  Times have changed.  I just don't care anymore.  There are too many people hurting right now.  Used to be these stories were buried three sections into the paper and easily ignored.  Now they're front and center on the first web page and you can't miss them.  
I always thought the NYTimes was a place for serious news.  This is article is a good example of wasted space.  
Let's get our terms straight here -- this is not a First World problem.  It is a 1% problem. 
And this essential subject deserves a front page ?
This is not news. By an armoir and stop perpetuating the stereotypes of Americans that people around the world believe. Firsts World problems are not problems...they only point to our social psychology and wealth disparity. Why don't you all rent out your gigantic closets that hold all those things of yours that you touch maybe two or three times a year to some poverty-stricken person who just needs a place to sleep. I'm so glad the war on social issues is passing so we can get back to the important class wars...and I'm being serious about that. 
At some point isn't it just another full room? 
Can we please have next, a front-page article about storage issues of New Yorkers in *other* neighborhoods of the Big Apple, where whole families often live together, in spaces the size of the "closets" featured in your photos?
wretched excess
A bedroom turned into a closet? In Tribeca? Come on. How about something that more New Yorkers can identify with, like a closet turned into a bedroom?
How much is enough?
I'm sure I'm not the first to say, I wish I had such a problem.  EEEEWWW.
How pathetic is this my 'big closet'' look-at me-syndrome. What's next- my super sized toilet?
I think the online editor got the date on this article wrong.  The conspicuous consumption detailed in this article is much more reminiscent of pre-Great Recession New York.  Surely, this was published before 2008.  <br/><br/>Or are the people interviewed so insulated from reality that they think its still acceptable to brag about spending five figures on a closet organization project?
The only thing funnier than renting a second apartment for use as a closet is a story in the Times a few years ago, about a man who rented another apartment in the same building for his Irish Wolfhound, who was too huge and messy for his one-bedroom.
Too. Darned. Much. Stuff.
Really?  Is this what we can expect from the NY Times' cover page now as top news?  How much money people have and are willing to throw away on their Closets?   With all of the important and critical issues going on in today's world?   Really quite amazing to review the NY Times Real Estate section.  Something is very wrong here.
this is obscene
can people be more boring?
Talk about over conspicuous consumption!
The rich can be a bit different...and how do they manage to live with their problems? But of course every single one of their household helpers is paid a living wage and the required benefits like Social Security. But of course.
"A closet so full... so empty inside." ~ from Spent: Memoirs of a Shopping Addict
Who. Cares.
Where's the line between "needing" a closet that big and being just a well-organized hoarder?
Front page news?  With all that's going on in North Korea, our budget, gun control etc.  For the first time I opened the NY Times and thought it should be branded "Privileged Times".  
The 1% continues to push out the 99% out of NYC.  What would Che  or Angela Davis say?
'The world has enough for everybody's need but not enough for everybody's greed'<br/><br/>- Mohandas Gandhi<br/><br/>This is sickening.
Wow - just wow.  A fish tank in the closet - now I have seen everything, some people can't even pay rent and others are living so high on the hog.  I really can't stomach stories like this anymore.<br/><br/>Why do I even click on them....?
In one townhouse Condo we lived in , I spent about a month of Spare time adding a pretty nice walk-in closet to our Bedroom. We had a fairly Large Bedroom ,which had an alcove that had no use. We were able to take the space ,add a wall without making the Bedroom feel any smaller. Took some simple ,Modern Ikea storage Units and built them into the design of the Closet.<br/>It was a great addition. His and her sides. It was a separate dressing room as well. It was my wife's idea ,and I built it. My wife Loved it ,and so did I.<br/>Doing it ourselves it saved thousands &amp; added thousands to the value.
I'm not just shocked that someone would pay $8,000 a month to rent an apartment to use as a closet, I am SICKENED!
Groundbreaking news! Apartments in NY might be small! One might not have room for all their stuff! Didn't George Carlin (at Carnegie, I might add) cover this a few decades ago with his famous monologue? I have to agree with Ms Bilenky about the consumerism displayed; the "let them eat cake" approach leaves a sour aftertaste for the rest of us and reflects poorly on those who are quoted in the article. Certainly there's a difference between having a place to hang your hat vs. having a place to hang 1000 hats... 
Yeah. Consumerism is alive and well in America. It is all so meaningless.
The hypocricy of New York Liberals right here folks.
oh my goodness! just don't see the point of having hundreds of shirts or hundreds of shoes - how many times a day can a person change clothes???
Looks like 7-8 figure types are doing their part to keep the US economy at our historically robust pace of 1-percent growth on average (once bubbles and busts are factored out).  But are they?  The mammoth misdirection here is that our nation needs a different scale of ?consumer? to create a viable nation.  Hoarding expensive shirts does not one thing for the future of our nation.  What we need to ?buy? to create a US future is infrastructure, energy and water conservation measures, storm barriers, and effective schools, correction houses (prisons), factories, hospitals, utilities, and research facilities.  If the nation?s future was a body (and it is) we are apparently feeding it candy and chips with this vapid consumerism of the ?me.?  If we instead feed it what it needs to be strong and great, we move upward and forward to the consumerism of ?us.?  This ?us? path is the only course for a healthy US.  330M people vote for our future every day in this way.  It?s our choice, a future sick and stunted or healthy and thriving.
The only thing funnier than renting a second apartment for use as a closet was a story you had a couple of years ago on a man who rented a second apartment in his building for his Irish Wolfhound, who was just too huge for his one-bedroom.
Calling Imelda . . . 
As a clothing hound who works to keep my collections in the bounds of my closets, I was ready to sympathize for New Yorkers with their their apartments -- then along comes this outrageous quote: <br/><br/>?If I?m going to put my pots and pans in a $250,000 room, why don?t I put my clothes and jewelry, which cost a lot more than my Le Creusets, in an equally special place?? I think people have really started giving it the homage it deserves.?<br/><br/>Honest to God, did she really just say HOMAGE?  She doesn't have a spatial challenge; she has a laziness and vanity problem. This particular wealthy person could custom build furniture for her collections - but that would actually require thinking and initiative!  Better to complain to the Times of the "need" to purchase perfect closets ~ pret a porter.  Gag me. <br/><br/>A more interesting angle would be of how regular people gain wealth by downsizing their clutter and upgrading the order and quality of their collections, thus making their closets fertile ground for spiritual and creative growth - a step Americans need to take. <br/><br/>Sigh.  And it is tiresome to see the western influence of "so much stuff" on people even in Japan, where I see people in the clattering look of too much junky clothing.  And you can bet all these folks would love more closet space, too, looking at the clutter of their patios.  Yay for the American lifestyle. 
The first half of your life you spend accumulating stuff; the second half getting rid of it. If you can't even remember what's in those closets, you've got too much stuff.
Yes, I am being judgemental, get over it.<br/><br/>this rampant consumerism is sickening.  
Anyone have an estimate for what Ms Ward might have paid for that closet?
If what you have does not fit into a regular closet, it probably means you have just too much stuff that you truly have no need for. Get rid of it: there are plenty of people in NYC that could do with the accumulated stuff in these closets. It is just stuff that creates the need for more stuff (closets) where to put it!
"an uber-organized life,"  If there is one word that should go on the meh list it is uber.  Please, no more use of this word.
Too much stuff, it's offensive.
The desire for ever more closet space seems to be more a sign of the sheer tonnage of Stuff we keep accumulating and less of an indication of a fascination with closets themselves, as this article seems to suggest.  <br/><br/>Imagine how elegant it would be to have good things (but only those you needed) that could all fit in a modest closet.
This is outrageous. I understand closets are important part of one's life, however, not worth enough to crowding out living space. Unless you can afford big close space without compromising other essential spaces, I think it is absurd. It must be another fad that is not likely lasting for that long. 
What do these people do for a living and why do they need so much stuff? I'm a capitalist. I own too many shoes. But these closets stacked full of so much stuff we don't need makes me a little sick.
The decline and fall of western civilization continues.
The person who dies with the most toys wins.
These stories always depress me.  When is it ever enough? More stuff, less content.
The path to a better future will be lined with less stuff.
Again, at the cost of "real" living space, and the transformation of a potential family home into a bedsit or pied-a-terre for the transient.
Nytimes, the premier paper of the 1 %.  Not that long ago this paper actually published interesting articles about real world problems.<br/><br/>Like everything else, it's all fluff and vanity now.
Meanwhile, the 99% in NYC realize that they've been living in a closet all along.
This sort of 1% stuff is sickening.  Have these people no decent values?
For me, it's inadequate bookshelves (or space to install them), not closets, that are a deal breaker.
Reminds me of George Carlin's classic stand up routine about the importance stuff plays in our lives.
I am kind of sympathetic. I just moved into a new rental that only has one, big walk in closet. I thought, score! A walk in closet, awesome. It's more than enough room for my clothes. But then you start to think...what else goes in closets? Extra sheets, blankets? What about my vacuum? Suitcases? My camping stuff? This seemingly spacious closet got stuffed to capacity really fast. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, in my first apartment in NYC one of the closets actually was just big enough to convert into a cubbyhole bedroom, and convert it we did.
I equate closets to workshops.  Kinetic, sometimes messy places carved out of the home proper to facilitate creativity.  My workshop is my favorite spot in my home.
Such good fortune! In one of the photos, the bottom two shelves alone hold well over 10k worth of goods. There are many wonderful charities that take good used clothing and donates to those in need of appropriate clothing to wear while looking for work. I do hope these lucky folks take advantage of those types of organizations and "pay it forward". I'll know I'll  look out for some of the cast offs at my local housing works too! 
Tell that to Mayor Bloomberg who thinks its a healthy alternative to live in a box. With or without closets, I would go mad living in 300sqft room, as the article points out I have many hobbies and where would I put the piano? Even though this piece only points toward materialistic examples.
Having lived in a house built in 1920, the closets are not walk in, you wonder what the original owners wore and purchased, by the size and number of the closets not much.  Would I want a walk in closet now, not really.
As reader Ilene Bilenky mentions, the article is really about obsessive consumption. Unfortunately, it is not only a "First World problem". This hyper-ego-centric behavior indeed has global repercussions. Plus, it's damn ugly.
I like my creature comforts as much as the next person, but the consumerism and self indulgence on display in this article are mind boggling.<br/>Instead of hiring a company to evaluate the content of overflowing closets, how about  reevaluating values and priorities?
If our lives as Americans weren't so empty, we wouldn't need to fill void with more clothes and stuff than anyone could possibly use.<br/><br/>Where I live people have three car garages full of so much stuff that their cars have to be parked in the driveway.  Huge closets full of clothes of which 95% the owner never wears and wasted a ton of money on.<br/><br/>What a pathetic culture we have become.
I find the over-consumption off-putting here. The idea that people need an entire studio apartment to store all their clothes is ridiculous. I am all for design and such, but this is so wasteful and indulgent.
This article only underscores the reality that the wealth of the 1% doesn't really have anything to do with "job creation" or any of the other putative economic arguments.  The wealth appears to go into self-indulgent consumption and accumulation of things they don't need and places to store them, presumably to provide more space for more accumulation.<br/><br/>I live a comfortable middle class life with a single closet and I can't wear all the LL Bean shirts I own, I can't possibly imagine how these people justify the volume of clothes they own, especially the way they must chase fashion trends.<br/><br/>We all laughed in the 1980s when Imelda Marcos' shoe collection was revealed, poking fun at her as some kind of obsessive banana republic dictator cum shopper (with likely more than a little racist schadenfreude), yet we think some New York aristocrat's similar behavior is any more justifiable?
"For $7,950 a month, the couple are now renting a two-bedroom condo a few blocks away on Madison Avenue from an owner who was not offended that his renters were using his home as a closet."<br/><br/>The owner might not have been offended, but I am guessing most people reading this are.  What vulgarity!  The manner of its reporting is also breathtaking.
"the hallmark of luxury in New York City is wasted space"<br/><br/>Let's take a moment to consider the fact that wasted space means wasted energy consumption in the construction and hvac of that space, and that there are homeless people who have no space in NYC.  And these people need wasted space to make them feel good about themselves?  Gah!  What ever happened to Obama's idea about mandatory community service?  People who have so much money they have to struggle to find ways to spend it would be much happier if someone taught them the joy of giving instead of the joy of wasting. 
When wealthy homeowners spend thousands on their wardrobes, it is no surprise that they may want to have a daily "relationship" with the fruits of their labor. Dressing rooms, filled with expensive designer fashions are the modern equivalent of a castle's "treasure room".  
I once visited the Park Avenue apartment of a very thin socialite who had an entire  large bedroom fitted with an undulating dry cleaner's storage system. You couldn't actually enter the room, but you could stand in the door with your finger on the control button as thousands of long gowns slowly rotated past. Each had a tag describing when and where it had been worn.<br/>She was in the process of moving to a larger apartment in order to increase her closet space.   
It's not only Manhattan. We lived for 6 years in the FL Keys, where most houses have minimal closets because they're built for visitors, not residents. Our 1100 sq ft. two- bedroom had a narrow walk-in closet in the master (major selling point), but little else--not even a broom closet. When we returned to Orlando in 2009, we bought a 1500 sq ft house in our preferred zip code with a nice corner lot and a two-car garage. But the real selling point was its six walk-in closets of varying sizes. One became a tiny dressing room, another a compact sewing room, another a utility closet (finally, a place for the vacuum). And yes, there's lots of stuff stored in all of them, so the smallish "real" rooms do look larger--and more tidy.
$95,400 a year just to store your clothes and shoes that probably cost 10 times that? Amazing that there are some people in this world who don't blink an eye at this, but think that $18,720 a year (40 hours a week at $9 an hour) is simply too much to pay certain "other" people. No, for those people $15,080 a year (40 hours a week at the current minimum wage of $7.25) is perfectly fine and probably also too much.<br/><br/>And they actually wonder why most of us want some sort of tax reform?<br/><br/>If this couple had less money many would consider them to have a hoarding problem and would be making fun of them while watching on some humiliating reality show.
We have a small craftsman-style bungalow, 1,200 sf, but when David bought his smart car we had room for an addition so we added a closet that is nearly 200 sf. It freed up our whole house (got rid of six pieces of furniture).<br/><br/>The closet is dark wood paneled with custom cabinets and drawers, a vaulted ceiling with a clerestory window, prints and sculpture. Four chests form an island in the center with a glossy red counter top, holding a large yellow art-glass bowl. The room has museum lighting for our clothes.  Our CDD collections are on racks behind the clothes (most downloaded, but we kept the C's and they had been in the way in the house for years).<br/><br/>It looks like an mens store with hats, sweaters, suits, shirts and shoes collected over decades. When we entertain we set out hors d'oeuvres and it's a very popular hang out for our guests.<br/><br/>It does sound consumerist, but since we built it we almost stopped buying clothes - we could see what we had. (which you can't in a five or six foot wide walk-in.
In almost all apartments, you can find a bit of space to hang clothes and store shoes and boxes. I've seen studio apartments with part of the main room blocked off to make a closet. Unfortunately, the cost of closet kit materials truly makes custom closets a luxury. Even those cheap wire shelves in the discount store become rather pricy once you add all the brackets and such. I think it's probably better for the clothes to have some air circulating around them, than to have everything squashed together.
Interesting. In my immediate family 3 of us have large homes 3, 4, and one 10,000 sq. ft. Now for the younger folks a couple 1,500 sq. ft condo's. Guess what, no one has enough closet space. Conclusion, no matter how big the closets are, or how well designed, they just get filled up. I noticed we constantly are buying clothing, shoes etc., but never giving away to charity items we no longer can either even locate, or some with the tags still on them.  Our culture of consumerism. Off site storage is also utilized but not for wearing apparel just stuff , overflow from the garages and attics.
We bought a foreclosure in Oakland CA in 2009 - circa 1923, the home is solid redwood framed but there were few closets in the bedrooms and zero downstairs - the first thing we did was put a small walk-in into the huge master bedroom, cut the existing closet in half to make the tiny one in our daughter's room larger, and take out the full bath on the first floor to make it into a coat/linen closet with a half bath.  Makes the whole home so much more civilized.
I sold my studio apartment that had three large closets in 2006 and I've been regretting it ever since. No closets is a deal-breaker for me. I recently went to an open house of a nicely renovated apartment that had ZERO closets. For some weird reason I felt personally insulted that someone would even offer such a thing at a normal market price. I'll stop now, the no closet thing is a pet peeve for me for sure, lol.
The consumerism implied in many of the quoted situations leaves me breathless. I am fascinated with housing design and like small spaces (and am certainly not in the league of those mentioned, nowhere near; but to have that much stuff and value it so highly... a real First World problem.
"But Apartment J drew only one offer ? for $450,000. That was the asking price" <br/><br/>Um, and the problem here is...??
