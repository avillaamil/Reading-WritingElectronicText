What about the human rights record of  the sellers like the US ?<br/><br/>Are we not they greatest purveyors of violence that the world has ever known ?<br/><br/>Are we not the biggest lethal manufacturers ever known ?I am glad to see there were enough votes in the General Assembly to shut down the Filibuster attempt by North Korea.   However, I understand that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad will still be able to buy tanks without a background check?at a Tank Show!<br/><br/>Seriously, how can the NRA equate attempting to regulate the flow of weapons to a butcher like Assad with an imagined ?threat? to legitimate American hunters buying hunting rifles?  I suppose my mistake was to use the words ?seriously? and ?NRA? in the same sentence.<br/><br/>If the NRA thinks it?s smart to align themselves with North Korea, Iran and Syria (and by extension, Russia and China), go right ahead, Mr. Lapierre.  Let me know how that works out for you in November 2014.Perhaps it is time for the U.S. to get out of the U.N.  U.S. already provides nearly 80 % of the U.N. budget, while most of the membership is openly anti-American.  Our tax dollars would be better spent on tax cuts.  Stimulus laws accomplish nothing.  Tax cuts and a repeal of Obamacare really would improve our economy.  Viva la revolucion.That's funny. The UN can't even manage their own resources because of corrupt spending and they want to regulate the world-wide arms trade? This would elevate arms deals to a whole new level of ineptitude.....Political theorist and philosopher Edmund Burke stated that "Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites...Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.  It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds cannot be free.  Their passions forge their fetters."  <br/><br/>The manufacture and sell of weapons worldwide and the continued hysterical response of the NRA to any mention of curbs on weapons is all based on making a blessed buck.  Being chained to a corporate master is not freedom.The United States is the largest arms dealer in the world by a huge margin. The $50 billion "black" budget for the Unites State's covert operations is among the highest reaches of hypocrisy.<br/>Don't over reach with this article. This is but one very 'small step'for mankind.'Pity the NY Times does not mention that this initiative originated in Costa Rica!<br/>My country abolished its military forces in 1948 and redirected military expenditures on to education and health for its people. This has given the country the moral authority to fight for peace and against arms` trade. This Treaty does not stop that shameful trade -more shameful and murderous than the drug trade- but at least helps to control and monitor sales, sellers and buyers.<br/>Given our key role in the drafting, negotiating and lobbying for the Treaty and our coherent historical peace culture, a little bit of recognition for Costa Rica in your report would have been only fair!As Steven Pinker shows in his excellent book "The Better Angels of Our Nature", violence has declined steadily over the last 10,000 years. This bodes well for the future, and gives reason to view the past without rose-colored glasses: we killed each other in greater numbers before the invention of firearms.<br/><br/>Americans today do not fear a Russian nuclear attack because of the arms treaties, but because relations between the countries are friendlier, at personal, commercial, and political levels. As a former nuclear arms inspector, I think a good part of our contribution was in simply increasing contact between the countries. Similarly, to reduce conflict in violent countries we will have to address root causes, not just the means by which the violence is carried out or defended against. That sounds obvious, but too often I see people ignoring root causes and focusing on the weapons because the latter factor seems deceptively easier.I see international laws controlling guns as having little effect on those persons/countries involved with arms sales. The bad guys are going to find weapons somewhere, with no regard for international law. Gee, that's sort of like our own crooks finding weapons without background checks. Duh...Two of the largest recipients of arms deals in the world are Saudi Arabia and Israel. Will these two serial violators of human rights and international law be subject to restrictions, or will this be yet another Western exercise in racial and religious double-standards?America's military-industrial complex costs more than the next 12 nations combined including Russia, China, the U.K., France, Germany, Brazil and Japan.<br/><br/>America can invade and occupy any nation even if that nation has not attacked nor threatened to attack America. Killing, wounding and displacing thousands. America uses cyber and drone war along with assassination of civilians including American citizens based upon whim and caprice. Daring any other nation or group to do like wise. Claiming a divine exceptional right to kill.<br/><br/>America summoned the nuclear and the thermonuclear demons. And others followed including Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and India who did so without being parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<br/><br/>America is not a party to any international treaty regarding criminal courts or laws or justice.<br/><br/>There was no treaty enacted here. It requires 50 nations to ratify the treaty nationally before it becomes effective even in the U.N. The American military-industrial complex including the arms and armaments mouth piece the NRA will never allow this treaty to be ratified in America.<br/><br/>America spends about 1%  ( $ 37 billion) of it's annual budget on foreign aid. And Israel a nation of merely 6 million( 25% of whom are Arab Christians/Muslims) gets 10% of that.<br/><br/>Egypt, the most populous Arab nation, is second. American aid goes to the royal autocratic dictators American allies in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, U.A.E. and Morocco.Iran, North Korea, Syria. And the NRA. The first 2 were part of the "axis of evil". Is this the kind of company the NRA wants to keep?Whether or not this treaty violates our 2nd Ammendment rights may only be determined if one actually READS the whole document, not by what various media outlets report about it. Unfortunately, our esteemed legislators have a record of voting without actually reading the laws they are voting on. My first question here is:<br/><br/>A. Will the USA adhere to this treaty"<br/>- after all, and many mention weapons from Russia to Syria: have not the USA sent weapons to the Taliban and bin Laden in Afghanistan? to the Chechnya rebels for use in Beslan? to the riff-raff of Bengazi for insurgency in Libya? to Pinochet in Chile? to all the US Governors/Dictators in Central/South America? To the Dictators, of South Korea, South Vietnam, Indonesia (under Suharto)?<br/>- Where did they not sell weapons?<br/>- Will they stop that dirty power trade?<br/>- or will they do what they said they'll do in Syria?<br/><br/>My second question is:<br/>B. Who will control them?<br/>- a country that keeps all others hostage with 12 fleets of nuclear arms carriers around the world, with every town and city within their deadly reach<br/>- and the proven capacity AND WILLINGNESS to use the ultimate kill in its own interest!<br/><br/>The answers here are:<br/>A. No, they won't<br/>- a warning may be that of the 101 treaties they had with native Americans only 2 were kept.<br/>B. Nobody can<br/>- and therefore, nobody will dare say a word if the treaty is broken from that side,<br/>- as it will.I have news for the United Nations: arms are sold to make money. The United States, Russia and China sell arms to anybody who has the money to buy them, and they will continue to do so; it will always be easy to find a "libertarian group" in any country buying arms to conquer freedom or democracy. The U.N. is a ridiculous, corrupt, useless institution; why are we still listening to their nonsense? The line which states future Syrias should be rewritten as future Syrias, Lebanons and Gazas. Why is arms sales to Israel treated any differently. As long as it will apply to Israel also, it should be fine.<br/>Else it will see the same fate as one more famous UN resolution which authorised creation of Palestine!<br/>We are much better off any which way it turns out to be!Very good idea.  Is it keeping in mind China and North Korea in particular?  Will America remain honest on this for sure?  Feel the gap of trust deficit will get widened further for sure.  When terrorists manufacture their own arms and ammunitions, what to do?  The only way is the human mind set should get changed for the good of the universe.The United Nations organization believes it can regulate global arm sales however the U.N. will no regulate climate change gas emissions. Which is the greater threat to the long-term viability of the human enterprise?I  disagree with many posters who blame the NRA for the world's arms trade and violence.  The problem lies within American culture and it is time to look within to find answers.<br/><br/>As long as approximately 70% of US spending is dedicated to the military and other defense, there is little likelihood of peace.  But deeper than that, the US has developed a culture of killing and death.   The US is the fifth largest executioner state in the world and there are an average of 3500 abortions performed every day.  And don't even get me started on the level of killing performed by the meat, poultry, fish and dairy industries!   This little arms treaty is a start, but the root of the problem of violence  isn't even being discussed.  As long as the average person condones the killing of criminals, enemies and animals, there's little hope for real, extensive world peace. <br/><br/>Each person needs to look within himself and take a stand against officially sanctioned violence.    When the majority of people do this arms will no longer even be an issue.  Follow the trail of the money and the stench leads right to the NRA.   Of course they are opposed to any kind of regulation to the sale of guns as this restricts the flow of money to their coffers and their friends, the gun sellers.<br/><br/>Apparently no amount of money or perceived influence is enough for this repulsive organization, to them the life of an innocent child is nothing compared to the sales of more guns.   <br/><br/>Jim Carrey does a fabulous satire on Charlton Heston and the men who love their guns (apparently more than life itself).<br/><br/><a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/0433b30576/cold-dead-hand-with-jim-carrey" title="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/0433b30576/cold-dead-hand-with-jim-carrey" target="_blank">http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/0433b30576/cold-dead-hand-with-jim-carrey</a>As long as we allow the military culture of America to dominate our foriegn and domestic policy by virtue of influence on our civil leaders, we will suffer constant warfare and hatred by many other nations. As long as we refer to our President as the commander in chief, we will be at war. We will have no peace until we change the culture of our military government. That's right, our military government. I will leave it to you to contemplate just how pervasive that military influence is.<br/><br/>The treaty will mean nothing to our leaders until they see the ignorance of arming others.<br/><br/>Strength through peace.<br/><br/>War is the insanity of humanity.I'm definitely in favour of reducing the trade in arms, but one problem I see with this treaty is that it only addresses the sale of arms to countries with dubious human rights records.  Now that could be a contentious point, how to define human rights records.  For example, the largest exporter of arm, the U.S., may believe it has a clean record.  This may be true at home, but how about its record abroad, with illegal occupations, invasiions, detentions and renditions?  We should be working to get rid of the international sale of arms, period, and not devise something that will allow certain countries to continue to export them unhindered so as to further their economic and strategic interests."The treaty?s ratification prospects in the Senate appear bleak, at least in the short term, in part because of opposition by the gun lobby."<br/>-This should begin a separate article!When has the U.N. been effective in doing anything except spending money?  The U.S. should never surrender "sovereignty"  to these phonies  in anything.With all it's limitations, shortcommings, and caveats, this treaty will serve as a seed of peace even if it fails to be ratified by instilling the idea of limiting weapons of war. As in all countries, peaceful intellectuals are dominated by the violent warmongerers whose way of life is kill and be killed, kind of an evolutionary extinction of the dangerous among us. Humans are indeed a self limiting species and all are in danger of extinction as now the warmongerers of the world posess nuclear power. The export of even handheld weapons can ultimately lead to a conflict that develops into a full blown nuclear world war.<br/><br/>I see two different objectives here; the first being the militaries of the world supplying their like-minded cohorts with weapons and the intellectuals who desire peace and life. The militaries are ignorant because the weapons they supply to their friends could easily be turned against them later while the intellectuals recognize the dangers and threats of those weapons.<br/><br/>The treaty may not be perfect, but it's a good start to denying fuses to explosive conflicts. Other nations who are brave enough should ignore the ignorant nations who attach conditions to it such as our own.<br/><br/>Would you arm your neighbor knowing one day you may be at odds?<br/><br/>Ratify the treaty, for your future generations."Among the opponents is Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican. In a statement last month, Mr. Cornyn said that the treaty contained ?unnecessarily harsh treatment of civilian-owned small arms? and violated the right to self-defense and United States sovereignty. "<br/><br/>Cornman is owned by the NRA. Where does the NRA come down on this?  They should support the right of ALL citizens of the planet to buy, buy, buy (and keep) arms of any size, caliber or magazine capacity.  Remember it is the purchase of guns which is the most important, their use only secondary.<br/><br/>Why should only Americans have the right to carry automatic weapons to school, church, the capitol or hospitals?  Let the NRA triumph the extension of the 2nd Amendment to all peoples, all terrorists worldwide, domestic or otherwise, without discrimination of creed, color or national origin.  Help spread American values!Whether or not the treaty has success, global examination of genocide, human rights abuses &amp; the arms sales that facilitate them represents progress.<br/><br/>Potential to support 1 set of abusers over another is real but not new, as Iran-Contra attests. I'm encouraged by the prospect of a disincentive for states to begin to rack up abuses that could readily limit their access to arms &amp; shift power. It certainly seems preferable to the current system of drawn out negotiation of sanctions by the internat'l community only after the bodies have piled up.<br/><br/>I'm alarmed thar the vigor of attacks on the UN or the treaty isn't matched by zeal to propose better alternatives. I'm dismayed, too, by assurances that all favoring the 2nd Amend. hunting, or you-name-it, will be against this treaty. It reminds me of the saying that, when 2 people always think alike, you know only 1 of them is doing the thinking. Could our thinker be the NRA faction paid by industries that profit from arms sales? A hint might lie in 1 reader's advice to check with whom they've aligned themselves - Syria, Iran &amp; No. Korea - a group w/ ulterior motive written all over it.<br/><br/>The world's problems that beg solution are larger than any of our petty urges - mine &amp; yours alike - to substitute canned positions for honest &amp; thoughtful discourse. If we can't find ways to tap our collective best to meet growing challenges, it won't only be the victims of human rights abuses whom we fail; we'll all be increasingly in harm's way.Though the Arms Trade Treaty has been watered down, it should be implemented. War and the sale of weapons has become an industry. The weapons trade industry has enabled terrible human right abuses.<br/>US Senators Moran, Manchin, Baucus, Cornyn and the 50 other US Senators who are blocking the Arms Trade Treaty in the United States, along with opposition of China, Russia, North Korea and Syria, are the reasons why the global arms trade will continue and are why human rights abuses will continue to occur.Excellent, a worldwide prohibition on small arms! Perhaps next we will prohibit the worldwide sale and transfer of narcotics and if that feels good we can certainly revisit the prohibition on alcoholic beverages. Remember how well that went?   I find it amazing that the transaction of weapons is being controlled more efficiently on a global scale between independent nations, than it is nationally. In my eyes this is a great thing, but also a sign that the world is starting to progress faster than the U.S. can domestically.I see nothing about drones, and  the use thereof, nothing that would affect the provision of arms to the 'rebels' in Syria, nothing to do with providing of weaponry and  troops by  Europe and US, in the destruction of Libya. <br/><br/>As others have pointed out, Israel would have to on the list of non recipients, as would the US, if this was in fact serious.  However, like the effort to prevent the spread of nukes, it would apply only to those nations that had significant reserves of nation resources, who refused to cower before the US and accept that only their US installed rulers had a right to any of their countries wealth, while the US plundered their resources with little or no recompense.<br/><br/>When the US begins to comply with international law, then I might begin to believe in these manoeuvres. You would have to be naive and stupid to believe this will change anything in the world. This is how the system actually works. The US, Russia, France, Germany, China and the UK (in that order) export the overwhelming majority of arms, to potential and active war zones, to state and non state actors to advance their own agenda. These countries always evaluate their clients, they know their market, which already doesn't usually involve rouge nations, terrorists and genocide because they aren't reliable partners. It isn't an accident that the largest importer of arms, India, China, Pakistan, South Korea, Singapore, are all in Asia and directed one another.I don't know what value this treaty would have in addressing the various armed conflicts in Africa in the short term. The common tools of violence in those conflicts - AKs, RPGs - are low tech and cheap. They are already widely proliferated on the continent. Preventing exports from China or Russia won't make much of a dent in the short term.<br/><br/>It seems like this treaty is more of a leverage for the West to use against countries like North Korea, Syria and Iran. This treaty can be used to throw a roadblock in sales of radar equipment, AWACS systems, aircrafts, avionics, and other hi-tech weapons systems that might pose a threat against any potential armed conflict the US and the West might be involved in against those countries. <br/><br/>North Korea, Syria, Iran are all potential adversaries for the West in the short term, and are all clients eager to purchase more advanced weapons systems from China and Russia. Unsurprisingly, the countries involved in these potentially lucrative arms sales are the ones who are most opposed to the treaty.<br/><br/>Call me a cynic, but I don't think this treaty is some landmark step towards global peace. I think it's just one more move in the zero sum game of global politics. Add Bahrain to the list of countries that the U.S. needs to stop selling weapons to if we want to be on the right side of history. Bahraini activists have met with U.S. lawmakers asking them to put an end to the weapons sales but it has fallen on deaf ears.<br/><br/>?New details have been revealed on the Obama administration?s weapons sales to Bahrain during the ruling monarchy?s ongoing crackdown on opposition protesters. The website ProPublica reports the United States has sold weaponry, including ammunition, combat vehicle parts, communications equipment, Black Hawk helicopters, and an undisclosed missile system, to Bahrain since the protests began nearly two years ago. It is unclear if all the purchases were delivered, but they provide a key window into the extent of U.S. support for the Bahraini regime as it faced international condemnation for repressing dissent. Although the weapons are supposed to only be used for self-defense, some may have been used against civilian demonstrators. Bahraini helicopters reportedly fired on protesters in March 2011, around the same time Bahrain made a helicopter-related acquisition from the United States.? (Democracy Now!, 1/17/2103)Will the US stop  or giving  arms to Egypt, the Saudis, the rules of Qatar, among others?  I will believe it when I see itThe NRA's gun and bullet manufacturer patrons apparently want to protect the right of murderers and terrorists to get weapons and bullets, not only in the US but also around the world.Another West attempt to stamp out Muslim rebellion in pro-USA countries. Noble goal but written by the lustful WH.Treaty like this seems an insult to our common sense. Is there somebody who believes that it would change something about the human rights violation?<br/>Sometimes it seems to me that the UN are in existence just as a symbolic institution, nothing more.This is merely the first step- not the last step- for the Western nations to limit arm sales to African nations that are overran with warlords.<br/><br/>The intent is honorable bit the treaty is flawed. It requires transparency which cannot compete against greed. A fine example is our international financial institutions that are still loaded with derivatives that almost took down the system in between 2008-2009.Global Gun control. Did the world's despots actually ask for this or are we just giving it to them on a silver platter as an early Christmas gift?In all likelihood, this treaty will never be ratified by the U.S. Senate.  That would be a shame.Thank God these people have more sense as a body than we do.  Maybe they're just blessed that they don't have people like Wayne LaPierre muddying the waters so they can do the right thing to keep the innocents of the world alive.The proliferation of gun exports to 3rd world countries also contributes to the abuse and deaths of wildlife, including endangered species like elephants, rhinos, lions and tigers.  Please make this happen.  Obama can't find 60 votes to get background checks in the United States on guns. Where does he think he'll find the 67 votes necessary to gain the "advice and consent" of the US senate necessary to authorize ratification? I am skeptical US ratification can occur. The US has signed an international treaty knowing full well that it will not be able to create implementing legislation or get it through the US's domestic super majority procedures required in the Constitution. In former times, the US would meet these situations by trying to comply with the international obligation before signing, in order to help make gaining the Senate's advice and consent easier. <br/><br/>By co-sponsoring this treaty, the US is falsely promising to allies that it believes it can secure the necessary votes domestically to ratify it. The US's domestic ratification procedures for treaties require a super majority. This is highly unique in the world. Most other require only the executive's signature or, at most, a simple majority in parliament. No one else requires 2/3s in a body as intransigent as the US senate. My heart goes out to the US's allies, who think the US is on board for this and are relying on us. I can only hope you blame and shame our senators when they don't ratify this and not America directly.To those who suggest the US provides "most" of the firearms traded in the world:  Did you read the article?  The US has 30% of international arms trade according to the writer.  When I was in school, "most" meant more than half, not less than one third.  I assume basic math hasn't changed since I attended third grade.<br/>That said, I believe the UN costs more than it's worth to the US and it's time to cease funding it and form a new organization to support peace, freedom and human rights in the world.If there is talk about transparency and not being able to sell guns to evil dictators - what is Russia gonna think of that? That is all they do. All Russia's weapons sales are to militaristic dictatorships and terrorist groups. Now obviously China and Iran want piece of the action. Those countries will never agree to anything that has to do with peace and 'good for the planet'.<br/>But this gives Russia a great advantage - they abstain, and just watch what other countries are doing, while it can continue to supply terrorists and dictators. <br/><br/>Unless Russia is part of the resolution, it is very counter productive.This is a good idea, but I am certainly skeptical about how this will be implemented. It's interesting that it is the Western countries who don't want to ban shipments to non-state actors, arguing that sometimes these actors need to oppose oppressive governments. But why do I suspect that the Western world will apply inconsistent and politically manipulated criteria in determining who and what those non-state actors are? For example, many would argue that Hezbollah needs arms to defend itself against Israel; indeed, one could make the same argument about Hamas, and Israel is certainly an "oppressive state government." But I have the feeling that the West will object to those who arm Israel's opponents, even as it continues to provide the Israelis with the means to oppress Palestinians. <br/><br/>Similarly, I expect that which non-state actors are deemed appropriate recipients will depend a lot on how closely their interests and actions accord with Western interests and desires to maintain domination and influence in different parts of the world. <br/><br/>Again, good idea, but the inconsistencies in Western actions in so many different places may well strain the credibility of this treaty to the breaking point. This is progress. Not a complete answer, but a start. It is historic treaty for the international community, but it's still a domestic issue for each member state.  This treaty could still be ignored. Countries are not obliged to sign. Even when they do so, it is not a foregone conclusion that their parliaments would subsequently ratify it. It is down to individual governments to enforce national laws and regulations, to implement the treaty. There are already UN treaties regulating weapons of mass destruction, but none to control  conventional arms that kill people daily. How a country refusing gun control at home can abide to international law restricting the sale of weapons?  a country, the largest weapons producer in the world? What the world really needs is for a treaty that prevents human rights abusers from SELLING their arms to other countries. But I suspect that neither the US, Russia, nor China, as the top arms dealers and uniformly guilty of human rights abuses (outsourced or no), would be willing to sign on.Over the years, the UN has proved to be a useless, costly, parasite of crooks and spies feeding off the American public.. What little it has accomplished, could have been done much better, and certainly at a considerable cost savings to American taxpayers. Do we, as Americans, not realize that our Freedom, as a Nation, is under sever attenuation? Evisceration both from inside our nation, as well as from without! We support more wrong causes, people, and institutions, than good ones: We fight wars of prolonged failure rather than maximum effort success. The 'melting pot' we once were, is becoming an ethnic, political, financially, derisive nation exacerbated by scrofulous politics. America is not a country to be 'told' what to do 'in its best interest' ... we are a nation who 'has' helped lead the world to a better place ... as of late,  failed in that paradigm. Weak leadership, hegemonic, obdurate, comitias whose selfishness has diminished America throughout the world. When do we Americans take back what made us great, the envy of the world? When do we become real Americans again ... pride of the free world?   I find the UN remains a completely relevant organization.  It's an epicenter of global information used to monitor and improve people's health, the environment, commerce, human rights, the plight of refugees, and political stability in the post-colonial world.  People who call for the US to withdrawal from the UN seem to be suffering from the delusion that "might makes right".  The fiasco around the US desire to invade Iraq, under the pretense of lies that were called out by UN members, should be evidence enough that such a delusion is dangerous and costly.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of failures, but there are a lot of failures in whatever organization people create.  There is corruption, but that's because people are corrupt.  The successes, preventing a third world war, discouraging nuclear proliferation and reducing the world's number of warheads, encouraging a more stable and transparent global economy, negotiating peace settlements, controlling the situation in the Balkans and East Timor, and acting as a clearing house of global data on the arms trade, piracy, human trafficking, and illegal drugs more than outweigh its shortcomings.<br/><br/>I think people in the US, because they are blessed living in a stable nation without the threat of hunger, disease and war (relative to much of the rest of the world) can't see how important the UN is. Whatever its shortcomings, the US-taxpayer money used to support the organization has been repaid by way of a better world a hundred times over.The under-secretary of state working on this says although not perfect the treaty will have an effect on violence and cut it somewhat. We can talk to the world to get this done by treaty but cannot talk to each other here at home without falling into in-action on guns and violence. I thought it real interesting to see the names of some of the countries objecting to the treaty. Sort of makes me wonder if some kind of list could be made for our dicussion nationally on our own problem. We have got to do something and do it now. Nothing was said in the article about the manufactuers in the US objecting to the terms of the treaty or the effect it will have on their bottom lines. Bring up anything about this country's problem and you hear from them right away. The article  today on putting armed guards in the schools seems like just throwing more guns at the issue to curb violence. This international treaty is at least curbing arms being shipped. It is something anyway. Let us do soething for ourselves.A  treaty that limits weapons from reaching human rights violators is long overdue.   But what about Israel?   For example, they have used US thousands of cluster bombs against  Lebanese people in violation of our own rules of usage.  Arms sales to Israel would certainly be reduced if not eliminated.Last year, the US concluded the largest arms deal in history--60 billion--to Saudi Arabia, the nation with the most human rights abuses, the nation from whom the 9/11 hijackers came, a nation which supports terrorists and disenfranchises over half its population.<br/><br/>Would this deal have gone thru under the new Arms Treaty?  No doubt.  Nations like Iran, which has not attacked another nation in 200 yrs and has more freedom than many of its neighbors, will be a target, but not its much more dangerous and abusive neighbor, Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>That is why China, Russia, and others abstained.  The Treaty is skewed against independent nations and will not effect massive arms sales to fascist governments like Israel and Saudi Arabia.You guys know the UN cannot pass legally binding agreements, right? It's a treaty among different States, signed at the UN General Assembly. I want to thank President Obama and his Administration's work on the Arms Trade Treaty.  I believe that this historic treaty is a crucial part of our fight to right the wrong of poverty around the world. <br/><br/>With human rights at its core, the Arms Trade Treaty will help create a safer world and will mean a brighter future for millions. The Treaty closes many of the loopholes that war criminals and human rights abusers now take advantage of.  It completely bans shipments on arms that will be used to commit the horrors of genocide, war crimes, and deliberate attacks on civilians. Huge news - 154 nations voted to adopt the first-ever international Arms Trade Treaty!<br/><br/>This is a historic moment.  For the first time, the world has a treaty to help monitor and control the flow of arms and ammunition across borders. It's a strong, effective treaty that will save lives and protect human rights around the world. <br/><br/>President Obama and his Administration played an important leadership role to ensure the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty.<br/><br/>For families in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, Mali and other nations wracked with armed conflict, the Arms Trade Treaty means a safer, brighter future. Ending armed conflict in poor communities is vital to righting the wrong of poverty, <br/><br/>History was made at the UN today.  Thank you. It will be interesting to watch how European and American will be shipping arms to Middle East despots (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf States).  It also includes a country occupying other people/land in Middle East.  Let us see how the 'Civilized' justify 'Double Standards' as usual.  Are they Human Rights violators of the worst kind but our 'Friends'.  A joke we promote and lecture human rights to others, and sell most lethal weapons to kill humans.  ..and recently the United States, provided millions of dollares in Aids to Honduras. Guess for  what the money is ! military arsenal  and the policie squad. The crimes and abuse against civilians, ( Lawyers, artists, jornalists, professors, students.etc.), is out of controle. The US   action  in helping the military is the most undemocratic situation  .  Remember Argentina 1976 to 1982? Honduras is in very bad situation, I hope the  Human Rights lawyers, are looking very close the america hypocrisy .We all know the  US interests , the unfair foreign policies  is so old  like the  constitution. The Oligarchys here and around the globe are very alive.  Things never change. Honduras is  another one on the list.I note the fact that those who voted no against the treaty are known American adversaries. This indicates to me the world knows the United Nations is a puppet wined and dined here in New York. The only people who don't know they are a puppet is Americans. You can go back to your TV now.Has anyone been informed about the complete list of countries listed by the UN as Human rights violators. If this "treaty" is approved, the USA is prohibited from selling and delivering arms to several of our allies. This includes Israel !!! Further, if this treaty ever gets approved by our Senate, is does indeed regulate the sale and delivery interstate of arms within the US via commerce clause enforcement, especially if the US ever gets listed on the violators list by the countries that control the commitee, like Libya for example. This is a bad idea, and even subjects us to a controversy relating to our Constitution and the right to bear arms, our supreme law of the land that should never be trumped by anyone at any time.I think is a good news a treaty on global arms trade that seeks to regulate the $70bn international trade in conventional arms. And above all if the treaty has been opposed by Iran, North Korea and Syria with the absence of countries like China Russia, Cuba and Venezuela, it speaks by itself. Less weapons more lives. I only hope it will be a fact and not only another useless paper and will be ratified and respected. I can already hear the howling by the gun-nuts in our own country who claim that this treaty violates the Second Amendment.  Of course it does no such thing but it will most likely affect arms sales by weapons exporters. And of course there is no guarantee that Congress will ratify it.  There are too many in Congress who owe allegiance to the NRA and the armaments industry and not to the best interests of the USA,Good idea. That means just about everyone in every country, including our own. The US does not have a stellar human rights record, most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.I could not agree more, Alexis.I think all UN are lop side weighing more towards powerful countries whether they are from the West or the rest of the world.<br/>I am sorry that the UN has become so political and is controlled by powerful States. I agree with patrickSo now the USA and the West will not supply arms, ammunition and smart bombs to rebels groups to over-throw the legitimate governments for achieving their goals of regime change? Also, such arms and bulldozers will not be sold for continuing human occupation, land grab or human rights violations? Or the resolution is only targeted towards few selected countries to whom the West has red eyes?  The United Nations is out of touch and  is the most useless program in the world.  The US does more humanity wise, than that organization has ever done.  Troops are sent in with little more authority to even protect themselves.  So many times the leaders have managed a way to prostitute the program they are sworn to protect by pilfering the people they are sworn to protect.  Herzegovina comes to mind where one of the troops exposed a human trafficking ring of troop leaders making  huge amounts of money.  Rwanda, didn't even use guns, the Hutu's were supplied with machetes that originated from Russia and killed almost one million people in less than a year,all because the UN refused to acknowledge the word "genocide."  The troops that were there to keep the piece could not do anything to protect the Tutsis which were left exposed to certain death when they were pulled out.  How about the Congo, Somalia and the list goes on.  So like I said humanitarianism is handled by church and state already and does not need this organization taking up prime real estate in the US.  The world is now too small for the UN to have an impact.   The internet has created instant information from around the globe and we don't need a bunch of "knee-slapping" people telling us what to do after the fact.  When a "pip-squeak", country like North Korea, can rattle it's sabor and put the whole world at risk, as far as the UN is concerned, we need a little more than just sanctions to put them in place.At least the UN are doing SOMETHING about weapons control. YOU Americans are NOT!  It's about time you in the USA woke up to the 21st century, your firearms treaty was made too long ago now, the world is a different place.  Just look at the facts of deaths in the USA from firearms compared to my country England.<br/>United Kingdom 0.25 per 100,000 people.<br/>USA                    10.20 per 100,000 people.      Also most of the firearms going abroad are also FROM your country!   You make squillions of arms!It's fascinating to me that the United States wishes to reserve the right to ship weapons to rebels they deem abused by their governments while trying to limit gun ownership here in America.The second amendment is not the only provision of the Constitution that is relevant to gun control. Article IV, section 4 also is relevant. If one state, or a group of states, were to file a request under this provision that the Federal government protect it against gun violence, the Federal government would be required to take action.<br/><br/>For the text of the Constitutional provision and a short discussion see: <br/><br/><a href="http://guncontrollogjam.blogspot.com" title="guncontrollogjam.blogspot.com" target="_blank">guncontrollogjam.blogspot.com</a> I am astonished at the number of remarks objecting to the effort to limit arms exports to those who abuse rights.<br/>I guess  such persons would also object to supporting the concept of liberty and  justice for all.This treaty should never be ratified by the Senate.  It is unanimously opposed by all shooting, hunting and pro 2nd Amendment groups in America.  Not only is it contrary to the 2nd Amendment but the 4th and 5th Amendments of the The Bill of Rights as well. The USA should never subjugate its laws to any foreign government or collection of such governments.  Of course the leader of American foreign policy doesn't care about the Constitution if it runs contrary to his own beliefs that citizens shouldn't own firearms.This treaty will never be ratified in the US Senate where 2/3 is required. It will sit in a corner, gathering dust like a lot of other treaties.<br/><br/>Let me say this I doubt it will impact the global arms sales businees.  Like most things that come out of the UN it is all smoke and mirrors  Enforcement will never be really effective. The UN is an ineffective organization loaded with corruption, fraud and waste. It has too many members to actually accomplish anything.<br/><br/>The US should stop wasting money on it and cut back on money we pay to the UN and its affiliated organization which are usually worse than the UN itself.  "...there were times when national liberation movements needed protection from abusive governments." Is this a joke or something? Are they justifying sales of weapons no "nonstate actors"? This is totally ludicrous. So you can pretty much sell weapons to anybody on the pretext of protection from abusive governments. I hope those "national liberation movements" don't become terrorist groups overnight. People are both the problem and the solution. People killing people with guns = problem.<br/><br/>People voting to limit gun distribution = solution<br/><br/>Maybe it's not the whole solution, but it's a move in the right direction. As the world becomes safer, focus moves from survival to relaxed contemplation of deeper philosophical and moral topics that lead to rights for everybody. This is the way toward global and local peace. This is another one of those moves that will divide the world further rather than unite it.<br/><br/>"The United States and many European countries say they already have arms sales guidelines in effect that tie sales to the human-rights records of the buyers and other issues included in the treaty."<br/><br/>This is travesty plain and simple, another example of our hypocrisy.  Does this mean that the United States will stop supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia and Qatar that have an abysmal human rights record?   Evidently, the current guidelines permit these sales.  <br/><br/>The world is ruled more and more by the law of the jungle, not the rule of law:  if one side has the power to impose its will, it will do so and find the justification for doing it.  "Although the treaty has no compulsory enforcement mechanism, it exposes the arms-trade process to new levels of transparency that proponents of the treaty say will help severely limit illicit weapons deals going forward."<br/><br/>So, In other words, the treaty is empty rhetoric... lol<br/><br/>Disband the UN now and stop wasting taxpayer money on this ineffectual boys club...One day everyone will wake up to the reality that the UN is a corrupt political org and then it will go into the ash can of history where it belongs.<br/>You might ask yourself, 'What is a Constitutional Republic doing in an organisation that is chock full of every kind or thuggish Nation that can be imagined'?<br/>I have been asking myself this question for some sixty years.  Why are we supporting a world org that has proven time and again to be totally courrupt from the bottom to the top.<br/>We need to withdraw from the UN and invite them to leave our Nation post haste before they help or corrupt administration to defy our Constitution and push us into a Civil War over our God given rights to self protection and liberty.Among the countries voting against the treaty: Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia.  The NRA is also against the treaty.  Interesting company the NRA is keeping nowadays.  Now we know who's side they're on.This is taking a page right out of the anti-gun lobby . . . let's do some things to keep the honest folks honest.  I am quite sure the arms dealers (and criminals) of the world are quaking in theior boots over this treaty.  <br/><br/>People, it is PEOPLE that are the problem . . . not the weapon of the day.  The USA is the largest arms supplier in the world.
